Story: 3,000 years have I been fighting. Every morning, the raccoons scratch at my eyes. Every evening, the skunks spray me while the opossums chew at my feet. I have never had any tools. I have only my hands. I don’t remember the place I came from before this. All I remember is the daily fight between me and these animals. No matter how many times I kill them, they come back the next day. No matter how many times I’ve ripped them limb from limb, they are here for their appointment the next day just as eager to tear me apart. They want my body to be destroyed beyond recognition, and most days they succeed. When I wake up in the morning, all my wounds from the day before are gone. Not even a scratch on my little toe. Why do these animals want to hurt me so bad? What have I done to deserve this fate? All I know anymore is fighting. The struggle. But we aren’t struggling for a purpose, we’re just here. No one else has ever peered in to our forest, no Devil, no God. Just myself, and a million animals who want nothing more than to see me dead. But I can’t die. I’ve tried."

Story: “Dad, you 're on TV again !” I heard Eric 's voice from the living room. I tried to stay away from the TV as much as I could; I always felt vaguely uneasy watching it. And I had *certainly* never seen myself on it! Had I? My memory was n't what it had been before the Great War, a fact my doctor blamed on the residual toxins in the air from all the bombs. I had n't actually served on the front lines, I remember now. I had some hazy memories of six years spent at the base, helping to train the real soldiers and spending long hours on guard duty. I itched absently at my left leg. It always began to hurt whenever I thought too much about the Great War, one of the many reasons I rarely did. As I did every time I itched it, I felt a strange feeling that it was n't exactly a part of my body, that it did n't belong there. But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry. And so I did n't worry. I stopped itching my leg, and stopped fighting the near-overpowering impulse to *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR*. “Dad, you never told me you won a medal !” Eric called again, and I smiled faintly. I did n't know what he was watching, but it must have been a fake documentary, I had certainly never won any medals ... Had I? *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR. *"

People have been in a constant state of being high. Until now. Specialised gas masks are handed out and people have begun to act strange.

Story: When Tyler entered the ward, his daughter Valerie was already fast asleep, her frail body no match for the potent cocktail of drugs coursing through her veins. “She’s been drifting all day, so you didn’t miss much, ” said Roni as she got up to embrace her husband. “How did the appeal go? ” Tyler smiled mournfully. “No luck there. They acknowledged my potential as a Donner, but I failed the psych evaluation again. ‘ Likely to succumb to pressures from family situation’, they said. No matter, we’ll find another way to get the money we need for Valerie’s treatments.” Tyler and Roni sat quietly as they cast furtive glances at Valerie, each lost in their own thoughts. Roni was the first to break the silence. “Did they say which project you would have been assigned to if you became a Donner? ” “They did, in fact. There’s an opening on the Renewable Energies team. They think they’re on the verge of a breakthrough, and one additional Donner is all they need to beat the Chinese competitors to the patenting deadline.” Tyler sighed, then leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes before continuing, “The hazard pay was really good too. 5 years’salary for just one month of being a Donner! And full psych after-care thrown in as well! ” Roni’s grip on Tyler’s hand tightened then. “Have the suicide rates… decreased with the psych after-care? ” “That’s what they claim, at least. Some still believe that the utter desolation one experiences with the absence of Perogon-X2 is irreversible, but hey, if that’s the price for increased mental faculties, up to a 100-point increase in IQ, there’ll always be people willing to pay.” Roni fished out a print-out from her handbag, and passed it over to Tyler. “This other group believes that Perogon-X2 is a good rather than bad thing. This ‘ naturally-occurring high’, as they call it, is the only thing keeping us from falling into a spiralling abyss of depression ... it’s the proverbial wool over our eyes, but for our own good.” “You and I are both scientists, ” laughed Tyler, “but you remember how we both thought that this surely was proof of some higher power too when the discovery was first publicised? Two birds with one stone! It keeps the majority of us merrily alive, while also ensuring that we would not run about unlocking the secrets of the universe until we were ready? ” There was no denying the contributions Donners had made to humankind. Tyler casually glanced around the room and out the window, and easily counted a dozen inventions which could not have been possible without the Donners. The hovercars, the bacterial foods with customizable tastes, implantable microchips for constant connection to the internet… even the drugs which commuted what would have been a death sentence for Valerie a decade ago to a mere ( if expensive ) annoyance. In a way, Tyler felt relief from having failed to qualify as a Donner. He had seen first-hand how some of the most emotionally-staunch people had been reduced to forlorn desolate souls once the Perogon-X2 was filtered out with the Masks. The degenerative process was universal – Donners would immediately benefit from heightened intelligence, but over time, they would latch onto and stubbornly nurse the perception that life was utterly… meaningless. Even if Donners were subsequently re-exposed to Perogon-X2, only 2 in 10 ever adapted back to normal life. The rest… preferred to simply put an end to it all. Roni’s voice snapped Tyler out of his reverie. “Tyler, remember how I begged you not to apply to be a Donner? ” “Yes, I remember.” “And you told me that you had no choice, because Valerie meant the world to you, and this was the least you could do as a parent for her? ” “Why are you bringing that up now? ” said Tyler with a flash of irritation. “I told you, I’ve been rejected. I can’t be a Donner anymore. We’ll just have to find another way.” Roni reached back into her handbag, and passed over a crisply-folded letter on embossed paper. Tyler began reading, and while he remained expressionless, Roni noted the bulging vein in the middle of his forehead, Tyler’s tell-tale indication of agitation. Roni wondered how much resistance Tyler was going to muster, but in her heart, she knew what she had to do. “I applied as well, Tyler, and they accepted me. They’ve already fitted my Mask, and I’ll be Donning it next Monday. We’ll have enough for Valerie after all.” -- - /r/rarelyfunny"

Story: His body was failing. He had taken care of it very well, but 205 years were a long time. Not a drop of alcohol all those long and lonely tavern nights, not a crumb of tobacco for the old pipe. He never had indulged in gluttony and he had moved meticulously through his sword forms every morning. Yet there is only so much the human body can take. And even careful maintenance of the flesh will not keep it forever. Two centuries had extracted their toll on their way past him. As Mathemer de Troy stumbled up the stairs, unpleasantly lightheaded and painful jolts firing through his hip at every step, he looked up at her face. His vision was bleary and slowly losing focus, but he still could see the fear and concern distort her beautiful features. She had been with him so briefly. Little more than 22 years had he had to raise her, teach her, shape her. She had barely been able to read when he first had met her, and now she would pass her Master 's defense with flying colors, if any Master would stoop low enough to haze ... a woman. Mistress'defense, actually - not that one had happened for half the millennium he remembered. The tower fortress was shaken by a shock wave powerful enough to make his ears pop. “So much for the front gate, Master de Troy .” She tried to sound nonchalant, but he still could sense the fear in her. He had only started teaching her to kill ... She had mastered the technicalities years ago, but the concept itself still robbed her sleep. Little innocent Lia Smith, eighth daughter of a small-town craftsman. “No matter. There is still time, and time is all we need .” She nodded and took him by the hand, pulling him up the last few steps by the remaining three fingers the frostbite had left him with. It was time. The laboratory at the top of the tower fortress was in disarray. Half the roof was missing already, and most of his expensive apparatuses were destroyed. It was frightening how much damage only ten minutes of fire from the mercenary artillery mages could do to a building. Cursed bounty hunters ... the next volley would take the wall. With a flick from the wrists he raised new shields, and with pride he saw Lia doing the same. She had come so far ... He heard screaming from the fortress grounds far below. Helmsfire traps or Golem Guard, one of the two was raising the blood price for his head significantly. In the center of the room was a contraption of two large chairs, back to back, sharing a single high backrest with a hole in its center. He looked at Lia, smiling sadly. He would miss her company. “You stand by your decision ?” She tossed her head, sending her long black hair flying. “Of course. The deal is much to good. Have any of your old apprentices ever backed out ?” “I never asked for their consent, to be honest .” She raised an eyebrow. “What made you change your mind this time ?” He smiled again, the warmth of his smile ripped away by lips revealing his full adamantine dental plate. “Maybe remorse. Maybe you are the first apprentice I actually like. Maybe you are to strong to be forced”. She smiled as well, then looked away. “Promise me that my mind will still exist .” “All memories, skills and knowledge - untouched. All character traits, morals and values - merged with mine, dominance lies with the stronger emotion. Magical ability - accumulated. The same is true for everything I am. I will not steal your body, Lia .” He gently took her face between both hands, between the three fingered one on the right and the spring steel driven contraption that replaced his left, and kissed her forehead. “I would not consider sacrificing the closest thing I ever had to a daughter just for another century or two. It breaks my heart to change even the little things that I will influence. I promise .” She nodded and wiped away a tear. She took her seat and watched her master use his spring-driven arm to lock her head into place against the hole in the headrest by tightly screwing down a crystal headdress. He touched her face in passing one last time. “Good bye, Lia Smith .” As he took his seat behind her, Master Mathemer de Troy regretted not finding another apprentice. Someone closer to his own character, but weaker. Someone he would miss less talking too. Preferably male, for the stronger sword arm, and the quick and painless ascend into the ranks of Masters. But he had never found another as talented and powerful as little Lia. And now the time was out. Life was not always quick an painless ... Mentally linking to the apparatus was easy. Linking to Lia proved a lot harder"

As Mathemer de Troy stumbled up the stairs, unpleasantly lightheaded and painful jolts firing through his hip at every step, he looked up at her face. His vision was bleary and slowly losing focus, but he still could see the fear and concern distort her beautiful features. She had been with him so briefly. Little more than 22 years had he had to raise her, teach her, shape her. She had barely been able to read when he first had met her, and now she would pass her Master 's defense with flying colors, if any Master would stoop low enough to haze ... a woman. Mistress'defense, actually - not that one had happened for half the millennium he remembered. The tower fortress was shaken by a shock wave powerful enough to make his ears pop. “So much for the front gate, Master de Troy .” She tried to sound nonchalant, but he still could sense the fear in her. He had only started teaching her to kill ... She had mastered the technicalities years ago, but the concept itself still robbed her sleep. Little innocent Lia Smith, eighth daughter of a small-town craftsman. “No matter. There is still time, and time is all we need .” She nodded and took him by the hand, pulling him up the last few steps by the remaining three fingers the frostbite had left him with. It was time. The laboratory at the top of the tower fortress was in disarray. Half the roof was missing already, and most of his expensive apparatuses were destroyed. It was frightening how much damage only ten minutes of fire from the mercenary artillery mages could do to a building. Cursed bounty hunters ... the next volley would take the wall. With a flick from the wrists he raised new shields, and with pride he saw Lia doing the same. She had come so far ... He heard screaming from the fortress grounds far below. Helmsfire traps or Golem Guard, one of the two was raising the blood price for his head significantly. In the center of the room was a contraption of two large chairs, back to back, sharing a single high backrest with a hole in its center. He looked at Lia, smiling sadly. He would miss her company. “You stand by your decision ?” She tossed her head, sending her long black hair flying. “Of course. The deal is much to good. Have any of your old apprentices ever backed out ?” “I never asked for their consent, to be honest .” She raised an eyebrow. “What made you change your mind this time ?” He smiled again, the warmth of his smile ripped away by lips revealing his full adamantine dental plate. “Maybe remorse. Maybe you are the first apprentice I actually like. Maybe you are to strong to be forced”. She smiled as well, then looked away. “Promise me that my mind will still exist .” “All memories, skills and knowledge - untouched. All character traits, morals and values - merged with mine, dominance lies with the stronger emotion. Magical ability - accumulated. The same is true for everything I am. I will not steal your body, Lia .” He gently took her face between both hands, between the three fingered one on the right and the spring steel driven contraption that replaced his left, and kissed her forehead. “I would not consider sacrificing the closest thing I ever had to a daughter just for another century or two. It breaks my heart to change even the little things that I will influence. I promise .” She nodded and wiped away a tear. She took her seat and watched her master use his spring-driven arm to lock her head into place against the hole in the headrest by tightly screwing down a crystal headdress. He touched her face in passing one last time. “Good bye, Lia Smith .” As he took his seat behind her, Master Mathemer de Troy regretted not finding another apprentice. Someone closer to his own character, but weaker. Someone he would miss less talking too. Preferably male, for the stronger sword arm, and the quick and painless ascend into the ranks of Masters. But he had never found another as talented and powerful as little Lia. And now the time was out. Life was not always quick an painless ... Mentally linking to the apparatus was easy. Linking to Lia proved a lot harder"

After all, it isn’t my fault. I’m good at my job, so sue me. I’ve worked hard to give the guardian angels a good name but I never expected anything like this to happen. This all started about a week ago. Ian was skateboarding, not wearing any safety gear because his mom’s a miserable drunk and his dad’s only a few IQ points short from a brick. Anyway, I’ve saved him from little things here and there throughout his life but he was beyond screwed that time. Like on a dead-on collision with a semi screwed. Yet I managed to save him at the expense of a broken tooth. And in hindsight, my sanity. Shortly after, he became the talk of the town. Doctors were baffled, pastors called it a miracle, and everyone seemed to have their eyes on the “wonder child” . You see, surviving accidents like that create an ego the size of Texas, much too large for a fourteen-year-old moron. He got some crazy notion that he was immortal and started to do a whole bunch of daring stuff – all things I had to yet again save him from. And from that, he grew worse with time. I’ve not been able to take my eye off of him for a moment in fear that he will die in some horribly gruesome way. After all, he’s my money maker. Which leads us back here, watching him teeter on the brink of death as he tries to wrestle a pack of lions. I consider standing on the sidelines for this one. After all, he will only learn through experience. It’s like what they say: “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” But of course, he’s much more likely to die than become stronger. He lets out a nervous chuckle as the lions stir from their slumber, stalking towards him. When they bare their teeth, the fear in his eyes is unmistakable. I shrug my shoulders, flying into the pit to save his sorry ass for the umpteenth time. It doesn’t take much, anyway. Animals can sense guardian angels and usually get the memo to back off. If not, there are other ways to subdue them. To my relief, the lions comply and return to their side, ignoring Ian’s juvenile insults. Once he sees they won’t attack him like planned, he crawls out of the pit. And once he leaps over the railing, he no doubt makes his way to the next dangerous animal he can find.

Story: **Prelude: ** “Brujeria ,” they said, looking about the landscape as they said it. “The one you seek is Brujeria. “Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit .” Agueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca was n't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself. Agueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. Agueda did n't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. “It tastes good, yes ?” A voice said behind her. She jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. She at once understood the fish was n't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it. However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. “No use for me now. You take it, you finish it .” Agueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish 's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. “I 'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry ... .” “The spirits told me ,” the Brujeria said, interrupting. “And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought .” As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. “Yes, I do .” Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone. “Again, they told me. The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them. Drink this .” Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling. It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared. This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter. Was this an attempt to steal her energy? Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them. “I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child ,” said the old woman. “The old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair. So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own .” Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap. The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm. Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe? Agueda once heard stories of the power of this"

It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. “I 'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry ... .” “The spirits told me ,” the Brujeria said, interrupting. “And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought .” As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. “Yes, I do .” Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone. “Again, they told me. The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them. Drink this .” Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling. It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared. This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter. Was this an attempt to steal her energy? Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them. “I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child ,” said the old woman. “The old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair. So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own .” Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap. The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm. Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe? Agueda once heard stories of the power of this"

Story: So this is where it had all led him. The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape, painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues, colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected, bouncing around the skies aimless and endless, purposeless, never to rest, and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors. Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout, pensive. Many things ran through his mind; his shitty job, his hateful parents, the loss of his wife, the only person he 'd ever truly loved. But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so. To most people, a reaper was a curse: a constant reminder that death was always there, waiting. An undeniable proof that no one lives forever, and everyone will die sooner than they think. The closer it was, the sooner you would die. Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements, they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified. This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying; as their reapers got closer, no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at. They called them Death Profits: a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved. The diamond guillotine, the snake oil supplements, the guided meditation and isolation, even the hyper-boosted trips to space; nothing could rid a person of their reaper. Which is why Ray loved his. Where most saw a terrifying ghoul, Ray saw a comforting promise. A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever. When his wife was killed in the car crash, Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes, his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind. In just a moment he realized it all; they were due a freak accident, a change of fate. And then, grotesquely, a smaller reaper, its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter*, arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother. His daughter in the back. She was being cooed at by her laughing mother, gurgling happily in her carseat, blissful in her unknowing. What could Ray do? *WHAT COULD HE DO? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind. *Prevent it somehow. Change fate. Swerve off the road. Offer your life as collateral. Pray for their earthly salvation. Something, something! * She looked to him, one last time. In that final moment. Her eyes met his, laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes, he could see everything, he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew**, it was too late, too late, and he would never forget. He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail, wind streaming in the half-open window, playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back. Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly, unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear. The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light, the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other. Her soft lips just beginning to form his name, asking him to protect her, save them, keep her safe: his wife, the mother of his child, his only love and the only thing he ever loved, *save us Ray, save our baby* and yet he failed her, just as with everything else, he failed her too and her would never forgive himself. *Remember, Ray. Memorize it. Remember what you did. Never forget. * Just before the impact he could not find his reaper. He knew what was coming and he did not want to live, without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die. But his reaper was not there. It was not there and then the impact came, his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood, theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car. She had gone through the windshield. There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her, cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle. His ears were ringing. As he failed to stand, he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly. He tried the door but it would n't budge. He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might, the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle. Nothing. He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass, and then felt a ghastly chill. It was passing through him. Her reaper. Bony arms outstretched, wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque"

How many times had Jim heard a braggard utter the phrase “Last night, I fucked her, and it was amazing .” Jim knew that these men had never fucked anyone.

Cathy caught the look of days past flirting across Jim 's eyes. After centuries of being together, they had developed an ability to sense each others moods and thoughts, better than telepathy. Even with close to a thousand languages and dialects at their disposal, they had found it most effective to communicate with their form of telepathy. It was not telepathy as the humans defined it, it was more like understanding someone so deeply that every gesture, every little shift of their eyes, gave you the entirety of their thoughts. Though humans knew of this ability, they had mis-labelled it as “love” and stopped pursuing it as anything but a singular connection that lasted the briefest of periods. Right now, Cathy could tell that Jim ( Or as she thought of him “My one” ) was contemplating the nuances of human interaction. This usually led to a great fuck, some gourmet food and listening to some great shit. The fourth four letter word, fear, they had long abandoned its pursuit, after discovering their immortality was, well, immortal. “So are you ready to finally start our ascendance? ” Cathy asked Jim. She used a mixture of languages to communicate, their thousand language version of Spanglish. Even with their telepathy, there was never quite a substitute for a word, it was still the most powerful tool yet developed on earth. “Yes. Finally everything is in place, the race is ready.

Though humans knew of this ability, they had mis-labelled it as “love” and stopped pursuing it as anything but a singular connection that lasted the briefest of periods. Right now, Cathy could tell that Jim ( Or as she thought of him “My one” ) was contemplating the nuances of human interaction. This usually led to a great fuck, some gourmet food and listening to some great shit. The fourth four letter word, fear, they had long abandoned its pursuit, after discovering their immortality was, well, immortal. “So are you ready to finally start our ascendance? ” Cathy asked Jim. She used a mixture of languages to communicate, their thousand language version of Spanglish. Even with their telepathy, there was never quite a substitute for a word, it was still the most powerful tool yet developed on earth. “Yes. Finally everything is in place, the race is ready. Still, it will not be easy, and this is just the first step on a long journey.” “Well, your brilliant friend once said “A journey of a thousand miles ...” Cathy replied, placing one hand on his arm, her warmth meant to comfort his soul. Jim smiled back, and taking her arm, led her into the studio set. The bright lights cause a momentary blindness, and as their eyes adjusted they saw their host getting worked over by the makeup department in his trademark floating leather chair surrounded by his trademark floating desk. Phil Lieberman was a world reknown scientist, a nobel prize winner in physics and currently focusing his brilliant mind on what he called “The future of humanity” . No one was quite sure what he was up to, but with credentials like his, people usually left you up to your own eccentricity. “We are going live in 3 ... 2.. 1 ...” “Welcome back to your favourite show, Past, Present and Future. Today, we have with us my comrades and well known science fellows, Jim and Cathy Kirkpatrick. I promise you, this is not a show you will want to miss. Now sit back, because soon, I will reveal to you the most astounding fact I have ever uncovered, and it will surely change the world.” Jim and Cathy smiled for the camera, glanced at each other, and waited for the commercial to end, the revelation of their immortality soon to end the notion of life for all humans."

Story: Ever since we were kids, me and the boys dreamed of our big break. We all played cops and robbers back in the day, right? Yeah, well, when we played it, we *really* played it. We drew straws to see who was cops and who was robbers. Short straws were cops. It was more fun to be the robbers, 'cause robbers are the ones who got a shot at making it big. At least they got a shot, you know? What do cops have? Nothing but problems. And every week we 'd pack into each other 's houses and listen to our programs on the radio set. When other kids were listening to Uncle Don, we tuned in to the Mystery House, and let me tell you, we did n't root for the good guys. Forget Charles Lindbergh, Torrio was the real hero on our block. This is some good bourbon, ai n't it? Got just the right kind of spice in it. Not too much, not too little; goes down just smooth enough. You ever try that shit back in the day? The bootleg stuff? Pops used to give me a sip every now and again before he got nabbed, God rest his soul. I do n't even know how we made it without him, you know? The early part of that decade was every bit as dirty as its name. Guess that 's what gave me my predilection for scheming. Well, we got a little older and a little smarter and we started to make plans. We were really going to do this! Like, really do it, and we were going to do it right. Getting in was the easy part, you know, but getting out was hard. We had to plan it from the inside out. But ... time goes by, things get put on hold, you get a real job ... “Real .” Like that word 's supposed to mean something when you grew up how we did? You ca n't just get a “real” job and get out of there. No, real only cuts it for so long. We 'd been talking for years before we finally sat down one day and said “Hey, if we 're gon na do this thing, we got ta do it now. We are n't getting any younger .” So me and Joey and Felix - Ha ha! Felix! Like the cat! - we bought some tommies from one of my dad 's old connections, a number runner from the south part. So we tell our wives - we were all married at the time, see - that we 're heading to work like normal, but we meet up at the park. We get into my car and I drive us down to the Fullerton State Bank. The thing goes off without a hitch, just like the programs. We bust in, tell everyone to drop to the tiles, and they put the money in the bag. Two hundred grand. We had two hundred grand in our hands, and we never had to fire a shot! Sometimes things just go right, you know? The cops must have been in the area already, 'cause they showed up real quick, a lot quicker than we thought they would. And who was the first uniform through that door? Butch Carwell, the bastard. Yeah, we knew him, so did the whole city. He was a mean son of a bitch with a bad attitude, known to light up like a candle if you push too hard, just like his dad. Well, that was just our luck. There was a swarm of police following him. We just set our weapons down and gave ourselves up. So Carwell puts us in the back of his car, handcuffs and all, and starts driving. We still had our eyes on that bag, though. He had it in the front seat next to him to take as evidence, but we could n't reach it all tied up. He waits for the other cars to set out back to the station and then he follows 'em. “What 's in the bag ?” he says. Joey 's kind of a smartass and responds “What 's in the bag? Money 's in the bag, you dolt! What do you think ?” “Funny, funny ,” he says. He says “How much you got in there ?” Felix says “Two hundred thousand ,” and Butch does n't say a word. He 's a cop! He 's probably never seen that much money in his life. I think the nostalgia hit him right then, see. We always wanted to be the robbers, cause they were the ones who had a shot. We see the cruisers ahead drive straight and Butch takes a left. Two more blocks and he takes another.

Me and one of my colleague were having lunch and a small boy standing outside the canteen was cleaning the window panes, he was hardly 10. Full greased head to foot, filthy clothes, torn shoes but with a cherry red lips and a droopy eyes filled with all innocence he could gather within it. It was raining and he was shivering after a while. He sat loopy near the window base facing me. I was having coffee then. As we started staring at each other I felt difficulty in drinking my coffee. It was nothing but me sitting comfortably inside the cafe warm and the boy now half drenched killed me within. I could n't read any thing from his face that he is not liking what he is going through. I called him and offered him a tea. Gladly he accepted it! I asked dont you feel cold, he told no I feel close to nature. I was so taken by the love and spirit he had within and his love for nature, the smallest things which I could n't realize which he made me feel was aw inspiring.

You are such a convict, and just got sent back. You will do anything to try and survive.

Story: I do n't consider myself much of a writer, and this is my first shot at a story on this sub, so if I do much wrong, I 'd love to know for future reference. Anyways ... *** I sat in the chair, tied down. I wondered where I would be sent. Previous offenders were sent to different places based on severity of crime. Serial killers or rapists might have been dropped in a North Korean concentration camp to be tortured and eventually die. Cases of severe fraud might have been sent to the Canadian wilderness before it was colonized to freeze or starve. The executioners though usually got a list of possible places to send the criminal based on their crime. They could pick whichever one they wanted. I know because I was one. I was booked for accepting bribes from mob to send their people to a place they could survive in. It was n't too hard because the machine did n't really keep records, and nobody really checked them since nobody cared. People could only get a general idea, within a few months if they wanted to by paying attention to the energy coming off the machine. If a location on the list was Hiroshima, I might have sent the mob boss to a few weeks after the bomb feel instead of right before as was intended. Regardless, that does n't matter. I 'm going somewhere where nobody will know me. Well, actually sometime when people wo n't know me. The new executioner was a rookie. I could tell. I mean, I could see the manual for the time machine from where I sat. He was taking a long time setting it up. Maybe he was deciding where to send me. The list he got was a few pages long. Would an executioner accepting bribes get sent to a horrid place like Russia under Stalin? Or maybe a less harsh place like an uninhabited island? I was curious. Personally I never dealt with people accepting bribes when I worked. The rookie looked up. I guess he finished with the machine 's console. Took him long enough. Damn amateurs. Wait a second ... Something was odd. I could see the status light from here. He was sending me to the future? I only did that once, by sending a mob boss a few centuries into the future. People would n't do that, too risky. The person might end up in a relatively safe place, or a really inhospitable one. No way to tell. Nobody could predict the future. I hoped for the former. Rookie mistakes, eh? The energy crackled. I was blinded. I opened my eyes. I saw ruins. They had a light dusting of snow. It was noon. The sun was low. Seasonal winter. Not nuclear winter. I looked at my watch. It had a Geiger counter. People wanted to cram everything into one device. I read in history how it started with cramming a camera, mini-computer, and a phone all in one. I do n't know when a normal person would use a Geiger counter though. Radiation was only a little above normal. Nuke Facts said that the level was like if I ate a few bunches of bananas every day. Kinda random, but it 's still better and more interesting than Cat Facts. That shit took forever to get rid of ... So I guess I was in the aftermath of a nuclear war with the clothes on my back and a fancy watch. It was safe to stand around. But I suppose I needed more than a lack of radiation to survive. I decided to head south, possibly to less snowy places. Good thing this watch had a compass. Something actually reasonable. Let 's hope that it also has a cookbook too, I 'm getting hungry."

You are such a convict, and just got sent back. You will do anything to try and survive.

Story: I do n't consider myself much of a writer, and this is my first shot at a story on this sub, so if I do much wrong, I 'd love to know for future reference. Anyways ... *** I sat in the chair, tied down. I wondered where I would be sent. Previous offenders were sent to different places based on severity of crime. Serial killers or rapists might have been dropped in a North Korean concentration camp to be tortured and eventually die. Cases of severe fraud might have been sent to the Canadian wilderness before it was colonized to freeze or starve. The executioners though usually got a list of possible places to send the criminal based on their crime. They could pick whichever one they wanted. I know because I was one. I was booked for accepting bribes from mob to send their people to a place they could survive in. It was n't too hard because the machine did n't really keep records, and nobody really checked them since nobody cared. People could only get a general idea, within a few months if they wanted to by paying attention to the energy coming off the machine. If a location on the list was Hiroshima, I might have sent the mob boss to a few weeks after the bomb feel instead of right before as was intended. Regardless, that does n't matter. I 'm going somewhere where nobody will know me. Well, actually sometime when people wo n't know me. The new executioner was a rookie. I could tell. I mean, I could see the manual for the time machine from where I sat. He was taking a long time setting it up. Maybe he was deciding where to send me. The list he got was a few pages long. Would an executioner accepting bribes get sent to a horrid place like Russia under Stalin? Or maybe a less harsh place like an uninhabited island? I was curious.

Story: In the morn on the twenty-eighth day in the month of october in the year 1840 marks the date first ever an expedition from the blighted continent found it 's way into an English harbour. The American ships, as expected, were backward, but not as much so as one might expect. While the ships they boarded were no greater than those from the turn of the seventeenth century, they were marvelous in their craftsmanship: Long bows carved with ornate woodcraft ( their gods perhaps ), canon of unknown quality, large billowing sails, clean and professional rigging and the men aboard -- truly these men had sailed and had been sailing for a time. They were as the queen 's own. It gnawed upon me that when last sighted centuries earlier, many if not all the continent 's people 's were confined to freshwater craft; merely pilots of canoes and small rafts -- Primitives.

Spying them with a scope from the pier I spied the visage of one man, A stern corsair upon the prow. He was stone faced and dark haired bearing no weapon with one foot on the bow and the other dangling over the edge, a lit stick of a kind in his mouth. He seemed stoical and unconcerned -- no doubt this was not the first port he had seen on his voyage in. Perhaps they had been to France and found no welcome? At any rate, as I scanned the deck I saw more than one other, and perhaps to their nautical detriment more than one woman aboard as well -- Though that perhaps spoke of other intentions. The admiralty has long dreaded this moment. It was, of course, inevitable. They would be curious as to why the world 's great colonial powers had stopped at their door, why ships long circled and barricaded their fledgling attempts at transport across the sea -- and more important why the lord 's anointed kings and our fair Queen held a line across an ocean for so long and then stopped. I felt ardour to call out a warning. I wished dearly to tell them that the few of ours who made it back from their sojourn died so miserably from having interacted with them.

Story: I held the little black box in the palm of my hand. Pitch black, perfectly cubed and nothing special about it, but it continued to hold my gaze regardless as if there were some deep importance about it. My friend Valhalla appeared out of no where and sat next to me, also staring at the cube. “What do you have there, Heaven ?” he asked. I continued to gaze at the box, refusing to look at Valhalla for even a moment as though I would miss something if I did. “This ,” I said. “Is the secret to the universe .” I could tell Valhalla was perturbed by this sort of knowledge, as if there was some evil about the cube. Or perhaps he did n't think such an object could exist. But I made it exist, and so it sits in the palm of my hand. He reached out to the cube slowly. “How is that the secret to the universe ?” I moved my hand away. “Do n't touch, it 's extremely delicate. It just is, like me .” “Just is ?” It was clear he did n't understand anything about the dynamics of the cosmos. “Valhalla, when you look at me, what do you see ?” “My friend, a boy like me .” I nodded. “There 's something else too. The one similarity between this cube and me .” Valhalla gave a sideways glance. “You 're both ... absolute ?” “Precisely. Me and the cube are absolute. When I wipe the existence of the universe, it goes into this cube and expands it infinitely. I become a part of the cube, trapped inside of it. It is black on the outside, white on the inside. There is no way to destroy or remove this cube from existence. It can only shrink or grow .” “I see.

Story: On days when he woke early, the President liked to have coffee in the Oval Office. There was something about watching the sky grow lighter and lighter as you sat your pajama 'd behind in the most powerful chair in the free world, sipping Marine strength coffee, that you just could n't achieve anywhere else. He was therefore disagreeably surprised to find a man in an understated grey suit sitting in that selfsame chair sipping tea. The President turned around and went looking for his chief of staff. “Mitch? Mitch! Where in God 's name ... .” He was met by a rotund, smiling woman who handed him an envelope and sat him down, gently but firmly, before closing the Oval Office door. “Hello, dear” she said and took his coffee away. The President reached for it like a child reaches for a safety blanket, only to have his wrist slapped. “Envelope first. Once you 'd read the contents we 'll sort you out a nice cup of tea .” He opened the envelope. He read the contents. He backhanded the teacup clear across the room and in a flurry of bathrobe he slammed through the door of the oval office and stood, quivering with fury, letter in clenched fist, glaring at the man who was sitting behind his desk. “What in God 's name is the meaning of this ?” thundered the President. The man sipped his tea, put the cup down on its saucer and raised an eyebrow. “You know perfectly well what it is, you 've read it” said the man. The voice had a calmness to it, but also a faint edge that said, without really saying it at all 'listen, johnny yank, I 've taken tea on lawns older than your country so do n't come barking at me for exposition', and the President found himself feeling ignorant and doltish by comparison. He sat down. “Well, yes, I 've read it ... .” “No one was more surprised than me” agreed the man. He shrugged “But when duty calls, what can one do? Can I assume you 've decided on a smooth transfer of executive power ?” The President flapped. “But ... but how can you.. ?” The man took a pair of spectacles from his jacket pocket and put them on. Then he looked over them at the President and he tutted. “How could we not? Honestly, my dear chap, today was completely inevitable. Look at yourself. Sitting there in your night attire, dribbling on the carpet and not for one sorry moment taking any responsibility. I 'm not normally one to critique others, but really. This is too much .” “But ...” “None of that !” snapped the man “We shall have none of that at all. You may not have signed the orders that brought us here, you may not have voted for the policies that made this inevitable, but you did n't oppose them effectively enough. Ca n't you see it ?” “See what ?” The man sighed. “It 's all true, is n't it? Faced with a reasonably well educated English accent, you really ca n't help yourselves. Very well, since you appear helpless and hopeless, one last explanation. “When you started kidnapping people and calling it “special rendition”, when you started surveilling your civilian population, when you armed your police with military weapons, when you restricted the freedoms guaranteed by the blood of your founding fathers, when you resorted to 'enhanced'interrogation techniques, when the news broke about Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, what did you think was happening ?” “We were safeguarding the freedoms that this country loves !” barked the President. The man in the suit leaned forward. “You were doing no such thing !” he snapped, and the President flinched as if struck. “In point of fact ,” the man continued “these abuses, and others - do n't think your human rights record at home has n't made a significant contribution to this situation - have all taken you in a regrettable direction.

Story: Two years, 142 days. That 's how long i 've lived without her. She was my life, my other half, and every other cliche in the book combined; I ca n't think of anything better to describe how much she meant to me. When I found out she was cheating on me with her boss, I ca n't articulate into words how much I was hurt. I guess it would have been better if she put up a fight for me - told me she cared about me and all of that shit - even if I knew it was all a lie. Because then I would have closure, been able to say “we left each-other for this reason”. But I did n't get that. When I first found out, she grabbed her clothes and out daughter and left. No words. No goodbye. The other half - no - the entirety of my life suddenly and without warning left me. So for 2 1/2 years I have gotten through it. For 873 days, I have made myself trudge through the featureless, flat, futile experiment of life without her. Trudged is perhaps the wrong word. That implies the ability to walk, or even progress at all. Instead I fell flat on my face, barely keeping my head above the muck for long enough to take a gasp of air and refrain from asphyxiating myself in a mixture of alcohol and self-pity. There were days when I would wake up with no memory of what happened the night before; days when I would wake up 20 miles form my house and eve still days when I would wake up with a throng of people I had never met in my house. Whether it was my own version of postpartum depression or a product of excessive drinking I could never tell - it was most likely a mixture of both. Last night, however, changed al of this. I went through my daily routine, the one I had adapted to stop my already speedy descent into homelessness, and came home to finish out my day. I showered, ate, and got ready to go into the bed I used to share with the woman I loved. At some point during the night, after I had fallen asleep, I rolled over and felt something hard on the other side of the bed. A million different thoughts rushed through my head, foremost being that she had come back. Had she been too embarrassed to speak to me and instead climbed int my bed to continue things where they we so abruptly left? Had I drunkenly called her and asked her to come over and she obliged? As the millions of thoughts rushed through my head all in an instant, I began to caress her - something I so greatly missed. I still remembered every detail, every freckle and imperfection on her body. Her hair - she must have cut it short, this felt much different. It was much more course than I remember it being then too - maybe a product of the stress of her new life? But then my hands reached her body. Her skin, much rougher and less soft than I remembered. Her hips, much smaller? This made no sense. In my half-awake stupor, I turned don the light to investigate the changes that time had brought to the woman I still claimed to love. This woman was much different. Her skin cold and blue, her facial features marred by a slurry of makeup clearly messed up through tears. What had I done? What monster had I become? I could never do this to an innocent girl. This could n't have been me. Even if it was, me, it was her fault. Her fault for leaving me. I loved her, and I thought she loved me too. Look what she had done to me, what I had devolved into? I was a product of the mess she made in her wake. She would see that. I need to find her. I need to show her what she 's done to me. This is her fault. I love her. She ca n't live, without me."

Story: The lone predator, the silent assassin, I felt invincible last night, but what had started out as a routine hunting expedition turned out to be a much more dangerous affair. Creeping through the tall grass of the wilderness, I listened and watched. Spring had just begun, which meant there would be sweet, succulent younglings; but they would be faithfully guarded by their mothers or families. All around me, the sounds of life filled the moonless night. Were I inclined to show the weakness that is emotion, I would have purred gleefully at all of the prospects around me. That night I would feast like the king I was! Oh so many choices before me! Was I hungry for squirrel, pigeon, or maybe even bat? Maybe I would have one of each! The air tingled with activity. How to choose my first meal? And like a sign from the heavens, my eyes fastened upon it. High in a nearby birch tree sat a sparrow 's nest, and three helpless sparrow chicks. Wonderful, marvelous, nestlings, still too small to do anything but squawk—and the mother was nowhere to be seen! I had truly hit the jackpot. I crossed the vast field between myself and tree in total silence, my ears low and tail swishing rhythmically. My claws sank into the bark of the birch tree as I carefully scaled the trunk, making sure to stay on the far side from where the nest perched. The higher I climbed, the more my ears swiveled, listening closely for the telltale chirps of the mother swallow. As a mighty warrior, I knew I must never be caught unawares. Reaching the branch on which my prey sat, I checked my surroundings once again. Still I saw, heard, and smelled no sign of the mother. This was too good to be true! Being a feline, my balance was second to none as I crept along the branch. I kept low and close to my tightrope, inching forward. This was the pivotal moment when I would either emerge the victorious hunter, or be forced to abandon my mission. The nestlings loomed larger in my superior vision. So close was I now that I could smell their youth. It was a mouth-watering sensation. Finally I was close enough, and still the helpless meals had no idea I was upon them. My muscles tended as I scrunched down for the kill strike. Like a bolt of grey lightning, I launched through the air and onto the nest, my razor-sharp teeth catching a chick by the throat. My leap had knocked one of the other chicks from the nest to its doom—a two-for-one special! As I turned to carry my prize down the birch, the fur along my back raised in alarm. I could smell her very close to my. With a deafening cry, the mother sparrow came swooping down from the branches above me. *Looks like I 'm ordering to-go, * I quipped to myself, proud of my amazing wit. If I had been a bolt of lighting before, I was now just an indiscernible streak of grey now. My trusty claws propelled my across the branch and back down the trunk in mere seconds. Mother sparrow had missed her first strike, but was circling around to come at me again. I zoomed past the other nestling as I ran for the safety of my mansion, giving the second meal a forlorn glance. No seconds tonight, it seemed. The tall grass around me rustled as the sparrow made agonizingly close dives toward me. My safety was in sight! Only a couple more yards to go. Locked tight in my jaws, the nestling fought weakly to get free, life draining quickly from the pitiful bird. I was alive with energy, swerving through the field with ease. My legs pulsed with strength. I would be dining soon. Within feet of my home, the sparrow landed a lucky blow on my back. I rolled to the side, the bird 's momentum pushing me off course. Quickly I sprang to my feet, baby sparrow still in my possession. The mother was coming back in for another blow, and I did n't have anywhere to flee. Reluctantly, I spat the chick out and rolled onto my back just as the adult sparrow was on me. She and I fought claw to talon, rolling around the grass arena. The fiesta sparrow landed several good gashes on my stomach and sides, but ultimately my four deadly paws and a clean bite to the neck silenced my attacker. I flipped back onto my feet, refusing to show any sign that my injuries were painful. In the end, I had won not one, not two, but three meals that night. Proudly striding through the push-door to my mansion, I carried the mother sparrow now in my jaws. This would make a fine gift for my servant. She had always served me well, so she deserved the largest prize. I hopped onto her bed, and happily dropped"

I do n't know what this is !” I had to laugh at the genuinely scared look on his face. Then, suddenly, he ran back over to the computer. “That man looks like ... David Tennant! And ... is that a TARDIS in the background! ?” I looked again. “Looks like it. Hmm ...” Suddenly ... *vworp vworp* something rectangular and blue started fading into view. “Hello !” said a man -the man from the photo! - stepped out of a blue box. “I 'm the Doctor! And who are you ?” “N-Nova ...” “Hello Nova !”"

My throat gets tighter, much tighter. He puts his face in close and breath on me, and I 'm unable to stop him, my arms stuck by my sides. His breath is terrible, it smells like rotten flesh. He puts his left, tattooed hand around my my neck, until a guard sees. This guard walks over, and tries to break it up, and it seems like my lunch-mate does n't even notice his prying or yelling. Only after another guard comes over to break his grasp does he release, and I spit and gasp, terrified.

You could have found some other woman, someone who would have treated you better than I have. maybe it would have been better that way. Before you came, ever day was like all the others. For decades each day was the same, the same dull pain aching inside of me. I was more dead inside than my subjects and that 's how it"

Story: “Malvina ?” “Yes, love ?” Answers the woman. “Do you love me ?” “With all my heart, Dieter. With every ounce of it I love you. What makes you ask ?” She says. Dieter shrugs gently, shifting in her arms. “I was just thinking. It 's been nearly four years since I came here and still ... Malvina, what am I ?” The queen tightens the embrace on her lover, tucking her chin on Dieter 's shoulder. A slight frown, one tinged with melancholy crosses her face. “You are a good man, and a loving one. One who I have never deserved. Your love is the greatest thing in my life. You are kind, selfless, honest and strong. That is what you are .” Queen Malvina answers. A look of rueful sadness crosses his face as he speaks. “What I mean ,” he says softly as he kisses her fingertips, sending fluttering waves through her. “is what am I here? Mordnacht says that I am a slave. Am I ?” Queen Malvina 's stomach drops as he treads upon the exact question she feared. “Mordnacht says a great deal of things. I would n't worry about what she has to say. That creature 's mind is half addled by time and the other half is full of schemes and plans. She wraps truth in lies and lies in facts. Her promises are worth their weight in gold, that is to say, nothing. Whatever she says, you must take with a grain of salt. You understand, Dieter ?” Dieter frowns at what his love says. Eyes hurt at her obvious dodging of his question. “Of course, but that does n't change what she said and which you did n't answer. Malvina, am I your slave ?” He presses. Queen Malvina 's embrace tightens slightly as pain crosses her face. “You are what you believe you are. If you choose to think of yourself in a particular way, there is nothing I can do to say otherwise. Just remember, you are what you choose to be .” He laughs softly, running a callused thumb across the palm of Malvina 's hand. “It 's almost amusing, I am the youngest person on this island, younger than even the little girl who looks no more than five years old. She is at least eighty years older than me. I 'm a child compared to every one here, and they treat me like it. Mordnacht says I 'm a slave, Sir Lawrence says I am noble man. Your subjects say I am beacon of hope and you say I am your lover. I am the only one who does n't know what I am. Am I a free man ?” Queen Malvina says nothing as the fireplace crackles, the sound of the spitting pinewood filling the empty quiet. Pain flashes across Dieter 's eyes, his gray pupils wetting with tears. “That 's what I thought .” He manages to finally say. “Malvina, all my life I have not been my own person. For years I did as my father ordered. I hid behind the notion that I was not a free man, that every death or act of violence inflicted by my hand was because I was just following orders. When I finally manage to break free of his influence, I was washed onto these shores. Even if you think you understand, I 'm not sure you can truly understand. Do you know how painful it is, loving the same person who holds you captive ?” “I 'm sorry, Dieter ...” Malvina whispers. A gentle smiles crosses his lips, causing him to lean over to kiss her on the lips. “We 're broken birds, Malvina. We were both born into lives of pain; you with your powers and me with my father. And we are both enslaved. Me by you and you by your own self-blame and doubt. The only way for me to be free is for you to be as well. Malvina, I 'm not demanding it from you, and years ago I promised not to asked, but ... will I ever gain my freedom ?” He ends his question in a whisper. Queen Malvina casts her eyes towards the fire, watching the flickering flames dance about the fireplace. “I know you and Sir Lawrence think I can change, but I ca n't. I am only sorry you were caught up in all this. If you had never come here ... I could have spared you all this pain.

Story: “Ummm ... hi .” Said the girl in the blue dress. There she was, framed in the doorway like it was a portal to another world. She was taller than Sam was by about a head, with eyes that matched the sea at dusk and hair the color of the dunes. A gust of wind ruffled her periwinkle dress, blowing a lock of her hair astray. She tucked it away nervously, avoiding his gaze. But Sam had already seen all that he needed to. He had seen it all before, a hundred times over a dozen trips to their little cove. But this time, out of all the times before, he was awake. *The girl in blue* ... He mouthed silently. Her blush deepened, and his own darkened to match once he realized she was watching him closely enough to understand. To his surprise, she smiled. “Sam, are you listening ?” His father said, providing a welcome distraction from his thoughts. “This is Meredith, she 's going to be staying with us for a bit while we 're in town. Now, I know she 's very pretty, but she 's the mayor 's daughter - so try to contain yourself .” “Dad !” Sam said, feeling his cheek burn even brighter. Luckily, at that moment the girl extended her hand. “Hi. I 'm ... Meredith. Nice to meet you .” She smiled just a bit wider. Sam reached out and took her hand. “Hi Meredith. I 'm Sam. And ... I know this is a little bit cheesy, but I think I have seen you in my drea-” Meredith woke up. She rolled over, silencing her second alarm with an almost-casual swat. 10:30. She was going to be late. Panic flooded her system, and before she consciously knew it her feet had hit the wooden floor of her room. She dressed, brushed her hair, and in a flash she was out the door. Today, of all days, she had no time to waste. Three streets down, across a little wooden bridge over a stream, and she was there. A cabin, one of dozens. But this one was special. The door opened, and there he was. Framed in the doorway like it was a portal to another world. Short, but endearing. His face was kind. It was exactly as she remembered it. But this time, out of all the times before, she was awake. “Ummm ... hi .” She stammered. She hoped that he did n't notice her blush."

I look around for the waiter to complain that he forgot my request for no tomatoes but can’t find him. “I’m sorry kid.” Death says as he chews his chicken parmesan hero.

He begins to talk but I interrupt, “How long have you known? !” I repeat raising my voice. “How old are you? ” He asks. I leave him with the tab and go back to my apartment. After a tub of ice cream and throwing away all my awards and trophies, I try to take a nap to no avail. I look at a letter on my living room table congratulating me on my promotion. I rip it to shreds and throw it at the television. My cell phone begins to jingle; it’s Death. Even though I feel bad for my reaction at the restaurant, I can’t speak to him yet. I look at my cell phone and contemplate what I should do. I scroll through my contact list and see Zac Efron. I won his phone number and address after beating Death in a game of call of duty. I never called it because I was a coward and didn’t know what I would even say. I press enter and wait for an answer. “Hello? ” a male voice says curiously. “Hi, Is this Zac Efron? ” I ask wondering if Death fooled me. “Yea, Who is this? ” He replied in a casual tone. I paused and my mind raced to put together a response. “Tomorrow 3 pm.” I say lowering my voice. “What? ” Zac asks. I start to apologize but he interrupts. “Look how young I am.” He says. “I am too.” I say feeling sorry for myself. Tears begin to run down my face and I hear: “Thanks for the warning. Look, I’m going to call up Vanessa and hit Vegas. Can you please make sure she gets home okay? ” “Sure dude. See you tomorrow. Have fun” I say. After a pause on the phone, he replies, “Okay, thanks I will. See you tomorrow.” We say goodbye and hang up. I realize that I should have some fun rather than moping the rest of my last day so I prepare my final outfit that I’ll wear tomorrow and then leave my apartment. I go to Death’s apartment even though I still don’t know what to say. He answers the door quickly with a surprised look on his face. He doesn’t say anything though and gestures for me to come in.

Story: He 's been my best friend since I was a child. I 've always felt different from the other kids. Growing up in a rich neighborhood, I never had what the other kids had; Ash got his first Pokemon when he was 5; Gary, when he was only 3. Because human-Pokemon interactions were highly encouraged, they would often bring their Pokemon to school and bully me with “Water Gun” and “Ember”. After one particularly bad day of bullying, I ran deep into the feared Turnback Cave and wept for hours. Why did they have to bully me? Just because my parents could n't afford the Pokeballs needed to catch Pokemon should n't mean that I could n't afford the barest respect from my peers. As my tears dried and the sobs turned to sniffles, I began to try to find my way out, only to discover that I was more lost than Diagla 's Adamant Orb. I heard crying and whimpers ahead, and, after approaching the sound, found several Geodudes and Onix intimidating a chubby and helpless Gible. Using my body, I protected Gible from the relentless punches and rocks thrown. It was the first time I was able to connect with another being. We both suffered at the hands of the many. As time went by, Gible and I became close friends. Though he maintained his stubby stature, his loyalty grew, and we gained each other 's respect. The first time I brought Gible to school was about a year after I met him. I could n't bear to leave him locked in my room alone for such long periods of time. The recess bell rang, and I headed out to almost certain harassment again. This time, though, I prepared myself for even greater harassment, as I would need to protect Gible at the same time. I could only strain my ears in hope that the bell would ring and call us back into the ( relative ) safety of the classroom. Rocks pelted my back, water stung my eyes, and fire charred my eyebrows. Suddenly, however, Gible began to glow, evolving into a powerful Gabite! No longer stubby and helpless, Gabite sported wicked sharp claws and a lean, muscular body covered in a hard shell. It seemed as though Gible had had enough of being a weakling and decided to fight back and to stand up. That day, my Pokemon and I grew closer together. It would not be the last time that Gible, now Gabite, would protect me from outside assault. As he grew rapidly in size and strength, the small bed I had formed for him was no longer able to house his powerful frame, and he soon moved under my bed. Though Pokemon to others may seems like monsters, my Gible was never monstrous. He was and still is the loyal and friendly Pokemon that I met so many years ago. This is my first prompt, and I 'm half asleep right now, but all criticisms ( especially content based ones, this is harder than i thought ) are welcome!"

Using my body, I protected Gible from the relentless punches and rocks thrown. It was the first time I was able to connect with another being. We both suffered at the hands of the many. As time went by, Gible and I became close friends. Though he maintained his stubby stature, his loyalty grew, and we gained each other 's respect. The first time I brought Gible to school was about a year after I met him. I could n't bear to leave him locked in my room alone for such long periods of time. The recess bell rang, and I headed out to almost certain harassment again. This time, though, I prepared myself for even greater harassment, as I would need to protect Gible at the same time. I could only strain my ears in hope that the bell would ring and call us back into the ( relative ) safety of the classroom. Rocks pelted my back, water stung my eyes, and fire charred my eyebrows. Suddenly, however, Gible began to glow, evolving into a powerful Gabite! No longer stubby and helpless, Gabite sported wicked sharp claws and a lean, muscular body covered in a hard shell. It seemed as though Gible had had enough of being a weakling and decided to fight back and to stand up. That day, my Pokemon and I grew closer together. It would not be the last time that Gible, now Gabite, would protect me from outside assault. As he grew rapidly in size and strength, the small bed I had formed for him was no longer able to house his powerful frame, and he soon moved under my bed. Though Pokemon to others may seems like monsters, my Gible was never monstrous. He was and still is the loyal and friendly Pokemon that I met so many years ago. This is my first prompt, and I 'm half asleep right now, but all criticisms ( especially content based ones, this is harder than i thought ) are welcome!"

Story: Jackson had been a soldier in the 15 years war of China back in 2225, and he had seen atrocities. Atrocities was a good word for his experiences there, he felt. Short, and simple. He liked that, because it made a hellish nightmare easy to grasp in his mind. He had seen atrocities. When he returned to the Fractured States after the American, and West European victory over China, job opportunities were scarce, to put it in simple terms. The war had damaged Jackson in a fundamental way. Physically, he was fine. He had come back unharmed, save a few small scars he 'd picked up sharpening his Bowie knife. His mind though, had been fractured worse than the United States had been when the Chinese launched the unexpected nuclear missiles that began the 15 Years War of China. When a man in a fine suit came, and offered him a job as a guard in a mining camp on a far off planet he could hardly refuse. Not because the pay was good, it was, but because life on Earth was frightening. He 'd seen what men could do to each other, and that fear would never leave, no matter where he went on Earth. The fine suited man offered him a job on that lush green planet that sat almost cozily on the boarder of the Milky Way. The life provided there offered him a feeling of security, and safety he had not felt in months since returning home. On this planet he could have a sense of security knowing that the total population was roughly 500 humans, mining the planet 's metal resources, and security staff guarding the miners from the planet 's local inhabitants. With a population like that there was n't a chance of mass war extinction. Jackson had never left the Earth 's lovely, life giving atmosphere before so the experience of leaving on a rocket was thrilling for him, and even, oddly enough, made him relax for the duration of the ride to his new home for the next decade. Leaving the planet he was born on had been an experience that he did n't expect to be topped, at least not soon. What he found on his new home shattered his previous exhilaration. Jackson had been on his new planet one week. One week to learn the layout of the bases, mine locations, and being briefed on the local life forms. At the end of that first week, he was introduced to the specimen research facility located 35 miles from where he landed, and another 43 miles further away from the mining operations. That was where he encountered the *thing* that would bring him a new thrill. It sat in a cell with steel bars across the front that were thicker than Jackson 's torso was. It sat with its arms pulled behind its back cuffed at the wrists, what Jackson presumed would be its elbows, and finally a chain around its neck that wrapped the upper portion of its arms. It was shockingly human in its general body structure. Single head, a torso with two arms that looked almost cartoonishly muscular, as were the neck and chest of this creature. The arms were long like a gorilla 's and it had short, stocky legs. It did n't look like a runner. It stood ramrod straight as soon as Jackson entered the cell hall and saw him. The human symmetry was were the similarities ended though. While humans were anywhere from a pale white to a dark brown this thing was red, almost like a fruit with patterns that changed shades of red all over its body. “That there mother is our prized specimen ,” began Captain Cage, Jackson 's supervisor. Captain Cage continued “We have him chained like that because when we first brought him in he broke the original chains we had on him and damn near broke out his cell. He mangled one of our recruits that got too close to the cell bars while he was rampaging. After that little display we thickened his cell bars, and gave him extra chains, courtesy of upper management .” Jackson responded with a simple murmur. He was n't much for talk. “I call him Rattles ,” Captain Cage said, almost affectionately. “He likes to become active at night and rattle in his cell, and keep us all up at night .” Silence fell over the two men as they observed Rattles, and Rattles in turn observed them. Jackson had taken a disliking to Rattles within seconds of seeing it when he walked in, and after another moment of silent observation he realized why. “Rattles is intelligent, is n't he ?” Jackson marveled. “More than intelligent. He 's god damned cunning. After we upped his security he spent four days just laying in a corner ignoring his food. We thought he had expired in captivity, but when we sent guys in to collect the specimen, the moment he heard the lock click he jumped up, and flayed Anderson 's arm. Thankfully we had multiple locks on the cell door, so Anderson was the only casualty .” Captain Cage explained. after"

It’s the same dream every time- I’m walking on a sandy beach. The sun is beating down on me, and I’m pleasantly hot. I can taste the salt of the ocean air, feel the soft sand beneath my feet and hear the roar of the waves. I am surrounded by golden sand and endless stretches of sea. I look down and see my shadow next to me. I look down to discern its shape, and then I wake up. The few seconds between dreaming and being awake are bliss. Then the hard reality comes crashing down on me. I look out the window. There’s a moon tonight. The neighbourhood is lit up in a soft glow. It’s risky, but I have to take what I’ve got. Hurriedly, I pull on some jeans and a hoodie and venture out into the darkness. The cold chill of the air hits me and I begin to shiver. I walk briskly. At night, everything is silent. It’s too late for anyone except for creeps like me to be awake. All the houses look large and imposing. The trees cast long shadows in the street and shake when the wind rushes through them. I start to jog to warm up, and soon I’m sweating. I think back to my dream. Every time, I feel so close to finding out what my shadow is supposed to be. If only I could stay a few seconds longer, I would find out. And then… I’m so immersed in my thoughts that I fail to notice someone on the other side of the road. We both see each other at the same time, and eye each other warily. Fortunately the moon has passed behind the clouds. He looks around my age; another bored teenager traversing the streets at night. Only he’s not impaired like me. He looks up at the sky and slowly starts to walk towards a streetlight. The universal sign of peace. I see his shadow come into view. It’s a dog. I’m guessing a golden retriever. Under the lamplight, both the boy and the dog stare at me, alert. If I was a normal person, a ‘ good guy’, I’d come under the lamplight and show him I have a normal shadow too. But I don’t. I turn around and walk in the other direction, and hear him break into a run. He’s afraid of me. The only reason anyone avoids the light is if they’re ‘ bad'. Their character is reflected in their shadows. An evil man creates a monster. I shiver again, but this time it’s from loneliness. Why couldn’t I be like everyone else? Why couldn’t I have a shadow. The moon comes out from behind the clouds and the light hits me. I walk, but there is nothing beside me. Hopefully I won’t meet anyone again tonight. There are still a few hours left before sunrise."

Hurriedly, I pull on some jeans and a hoodie and venture out into the darkness. The cold chill of the air hits me and I begin to shiver. I walk briskly. At night, everything is silent. It’s too late for anyone except for creeps like me to be awake. All the houses look large and imposing. The trees cast long shadows in the street and shake when the wind rushes through them. I start to jog to warm up, and soon I’m sweating. I think back to my dream. Every time, I feel so close to finding out what my shadow is supposed to be. If only I could stay a few seconds longer, I would find out. And then… I’m so immersed in my thoughts that I fail to notice someone on the other side of the road. We both see each other at the same time, and eye each other warily. Fortunately the moon has passed behind the clouds. He looks around my age; another bored teenager traversing the streets at night. Only he’s not impaired like me. He looks up at the sky and slowly starts to walk towards a streetlight. The universal sign of peace. I see his shadow come into view. It’s a dog. I’m guessing a golden retriever. Under the lamplight, both the boy and the dog stare at me, alert. If I was a normal person, a ‘ good guy’, I’d come under the lamplight and show him I have a normal shadow too. But I don’t. I turn around and walk in the other direction, and hear him break into a run. He’s afraid of me. The only reason anyone avoids the light is if they’re ‘ bad'. Their character is reflected in their shadows. An evil man creates a monster. I shiver again, but this time it’s from loneliness. Why couldn’t I be like everyone else? Why couldn’t I have a shadow. The moon comes out from behind the clouds and the light hits me. I walk, but there is nothing beside me. Hopefully I won’t meet anyone again tonight. There are still a few hours left before sunrise."

Story: 50 years is a long time, enough time to go crazy and return sane. I remember before it happened, the [ CDC joked that they would have a cure “within a week” ] ( http: //www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm ) when they had n't been able to cure HIV in 32 years, they had known about herpes for 2385 years and only had a treatment, and the flu remained a menace up until there were n't enough humans left to contract it. To the credit of the scientists, they all worked until the only thought they had was about their brain cravings. I had had a new “stem cell” treatment the year before, it helped recover some of the nerve damage i had gotten when i was young and had to have a surgery to correct a malformation. In those days, it seemed that the end to all disease and disfigurement were just around the corner, technology and biology hand in hand to save the human race. The funny thing is, my only guess to my resistance to the zombie infection and the zombies total lack of interest in me is probably due to the stem cell treatment somehow. The outbreak did n't take long, it started with a HIV like infection where only if you were bitten or zombie bodily fluids came in contact with someone, only then could you be infected. The virus became symbiotically linked to a bacterial group, then also a mold. With new methods of transmission, only the people on the ISS were safe from infection ... They got to starve to death and have a front row seat to the end of the world. By the time the infection made it here, there was no time for panic. The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water.. by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone. It 's spread was attributed to standing water in the water traps of sinks and toilets and their connection to the sewage system. time from infection to zombie was about 6 hours, and was mostly flu like. some people simply fell asleep never to wake with a human thought again. The thing about zombies that most zombie movies neglect is thermodynamics. Zombies do n't eat other zombies, and most animals can flee zombies or are immune. This means that a zombie must consume material to continue locomotion, and that energy must be expended to remain “alive”. Once the zombie 's guts had rotten past usability, a zombie would only be able to live for about 32 hours. Given that the zombie would run out of ATP fairly quickly, they would spend most of that time too stiff to move. This meant that anyone who was smart enough to remain out of sight, would be able to survive. The actual “zombie apocalypse” lasted about 3 years. Year two I went a bit crazy, I went through a mental breakdown where I assumed I myself must be a zombie and joined a horde. We chased some wildlife, and ate the remains of some survivors that starved to death. It was the sight of that rotting family that snapped me out of it, I slipped away and let the horde.. do their thing ... but that was 48 years ago, with eternal youth and a city of books and movies you can learn to do anything. So I learned to do pretty much everything. I was n't going to die anytime soon, I had a garden and traps set up within year 4. So it was easy to learn to make and do everything. One of the things i did was set up a “mesh network”, reprogramming WiFi routers to make a city-wide network that could allow me to monitor and automate things. Stealing some solar panels off of highway department signage and daisy-chaining them, I was able to muster enough power to keep the local radio station transmitting. I linked the computer up to my mesh network so I would n't have to set foot in there again. I set up heat sensitive cameras on every entrance into the city and tuned in random radios to my station, kinda like turning on the tv when your home alone, except with a whole city. For a whole year, I scavenged every solar panel i could find. From the bigger ones that the city put on their structures to going through offices for their pocket calculators. I scavenged other things too, Canned food, WiFi Routers, Medication, security cameras, loose wiring, movies, books, video games, Hard drives, portable PCs, IDs, Photos, phones, anything that may have held the voices and images of other people. I would also gather electric cars, with solar, i could charge them and use them. The wrecked and damaged ones could be used for parts, the ones in good condition I would store indoors to use as ether. A Camry Hybrid power cell and an alternator attached to a windmill or a solar cell could keep a couple WiFi routers chugging along for a few days. A single hybrid contains 34 of them. The mesh network also has a feature where any new nodes and unrecognized WiFi scans are reported to me."

Story: I had n't got much of a look outside. We were remote, that was for sure. Snow and trees for eons. I grew up somewhere a bit more crowded. I figured they had too. A bunch of city kids in the sticks. I did n't join the Army for this. I joined to fight. The cow chow was not so bad. There was an egg in it. I wondered where it came from. A whole egg, just for me. Gosha left again. She was gone a lot. I was n't even sure if she slept here. I figured it had been over a day but I was n't sure.

He seemed to be about halfway through. “You gon na give us a story ?” There was the faintest edge of darkness in the windows. I figured it got dark early here. It got dark early back home. He looked up. “Ce ?” “I do n't see anyone else, now that Hayworth left the stage. Come on. I 'm bored outta my mind .” I should have packed a book. All I had was a few letters from Bill and Ma and some of the girls from school. They were all old. I wonder if they sent my Ma a telegram. I really hope it was a letter though. Good thing Bill 's young. No way I want him mixed up in this. Sebastian waved the book. I sighed. Jesus. I know he was n't stupid. He waved it again then grinned. Oh Christ. Asshole thought he was funny. “Yeah, yeah. You 're a riot. Come on Chapman .” Sebastian cleared his throat loudly. Then he dramatically turned back to the first page. What a ham. “Când privesc mult timp un punct fix pe perete mi se întâmplă câteodată să nu mai ştiu nici cine sunt, nici unde mă aflu. Simt atunci lipsa identităţii mele de departe ca şi cum aş fi devenit ...” I just listened to him read. I had no idea what it was but it was relaxing. It reminded me of my Dad. When he was alright, which was n't often, he would sit at the doorway with the light behind him and read me and Bill some Dickens. He did n't do voices or anything like that. He would just read in this even tone. I did n't cry. I could feel something like it but I held it down. I could feel the draft against my fingers. After a while Sebastian trailed off. He was just looking at his lap, the book spread across his legs. I recognized the empty look. I knocked my fist on the floor. “Get to bed. I 'll be alright. Go on .” He rocked to his feet. It seemed to take an age for him to cross to the cot. He hand to brace himself on the frame. As he coughed his shoulders shook. It sounded dry. I closed my eyes. I did n't mind him so much. The Italians I knew from back home were alright and the ones in Rome were coy but not unkind. I got to see the Vatican. That was a hell of a thing. It was possibly the quietest place I ever been. The walls were tall and thick. Felt like you could ride out a bombardment there. Hell, felt like you could ride out the whole war there. I did n't tell anyone but for a minute I almost wanted to. I was still awake when Gosha returned. She smelled like the metallic cold. I must have done something because she caught me. The gloves kept her hands warm. The stiches did n't feel so tight. She even smiled at me. Was n't personal but it was nice anyway. “Sebastain read me a book .” I said. Gosha looked a him. He was curled up like a kid. She shook her head. “Is he going to die ?” She shrugged. The distance was back. She must have brought him here. Must have brought the both of us. I was going to go crazy like this. “Die ?” I pretend to go limp. Gosha shrugged again. She put a bag in the table. There was a sack of some sort of grain, a few eggs, a knob of butter. Gosha frowned at the food. Then she collected my bowl off the floor. The cow chow had gone crusty inside. She stacked Sebastian 's inside of it. I watched her sit at the table and bury her face in her arms. She did n't cry either. Where Gosha went she did n't let Sebastian tag along. He walked the length of the room. I was bored enough to put out my eyes. What I would"

Story: I had n't got much of a look outside. We were remote, that was for sure. Snow and trees for eons. I grew up somewhere a bit more crowded. I figured they had too. A bunch of city kids in the sticks. I did n't join the Army for this. I joined to fight. The cow chow was not so bad. There was an egg in it. I wondered where it came from. A whole egg, just for me. Gosha left again. She was gone a lot. I was n't even sure if she slept here. I figured it had been over a day but I was n't sure. Sebastian was sitting on the floor, using the leg of the table as a back rest. The book looked pretty big. He seemed to be about halfway through. “You gon na give us a story ?” There was the faintest edge of darkness in the windows. I figured it got dark early here. It got dark early back home. He looked up. “Ce ?” “I do n't see anyone else, now that Hayworth left the stage. Come on. I 'm bored outta my mind .” I should have packed a book. All I had was a few letters from Bill and Ma and some of the girls from school. They were all old. I wonder if they sent my Ma a telegram. I really hope it was a letter though. Good thing Bill 's young. No way I want him mixed up in this. Sebastian waved the book. I sighed. Jesus. I know he was n't stupid. He waved it again then grinned. Oh Christ. Asshole thought he was funny. “Yeah, yeah. You 're a riot. Come on Chapman .” Sebastian cleared his throat loudly. Then he dramatically turned back to the first page. What a ham. “Când privesc mult timp un punct fix pe perete mi se întâmplă câteodată să nu mai ştiu nici cine sunt, nici unde mă aflu. Simt atunci lipsa identităţii mele de departe ca şi cum aş fi devenit ...” I just listened to him read. I had no idea what it was but it was relaxing. It reminded me of my Dad. When he was alright, which was n't often, he would sit at the doorway with the light behind him and read me and Bill some Dickens. He did n't do voices or anything like that. He would just read in this even tone. I did n't cry. I could feel something like it but I held it down. I could feel the draft against my fingers. After a while Sebastian trailed off. He was just looking at his lap, the book spread across his legs. I recognized the empty look. I knocked my fist on the floor. “Get to bed. I 'll be alright. Go on .” He rocked to his feet.

Story: The lights on the Ferris Wheel went out just as I usherred the final rider down the platform. A short line was still waiting at the gate, time for the last ride of the night. I take two tickets, rip them in half and put them in my pocket. “I 've never been on this ride before” “Just lean against the wall, this one is the best .” “You said the boat was the best .” The young couple walked up the ramp. I take a ticket, rip it in half, put it in my pocket. “Are you closing? I still have four tickets !” “Yeah, last ride. We 'll be open until 6pm tomorrow .” The wirey brown haired boy walks up the ramp, not quite frowning. His parents stand at the gate arguing about who will get him on Halloween. He wo n't be using his tickets tomorrow. “You closing homie, just let me on this one .” “Sorry, bro. Got ta have a ticket .” “Man I know you closin', jus'let me an'my boys ride this time. No one will know. Yall won'even be here monday .” “No, move out of the way .” Two middle age women hand me tickets and push past the freeloaders. “I got two, sorry man .” I take the tickets, two teenage boys walk up the ramp leaving the third behind. He scowls at me and pulls out his phone. “Homie, they closin'. Come get us. Yeah I got you. The 7-11 ...” I close the gate and walk up the ramp. All riders are evenly spaced around the outside of the gravatron, each leaning against a pad along the wall. I glance around at each of them, standard safety check. I take my seat in the center of the ride and look down the ramp making sure the gate is closed and the ramp is clear before pressing the button to raise it. POP-POP ... POP Gunshots ring out and suddenly the atmosphere of the midway changes. Through the half closed door I see crowds scatter. Everyone is sprinting away from the ticket booth, jumping over fences, ducking behind rides and stands. Everything is moving slowly and for a moment I see the parents of the boy considering how to get to him. The door finishes closing and I jump from my chair. There is a hatch in the floor of the ride. I open it and look around at my passengers, all of them terrified. “Get in .” The two teenage boys jump down move aside, then the two women, the couple. The boy is about to jump and I stop him. “Go that way .” I point towards the back of the ride facing away from the ticket booth and towards a highway underpass. There 's no paneling on that side and the fencing is already open for when I have my smoke breaks. POP-POP As the other passengers leave I close the hatch and look at the boy. “Do you have a phone ?” “No” “Do you know your parents phone numbers ?” “I know my moms .” I pull out my phone and sit in the controll booth. I flick a set of switches and the lights, both inside and out, turn off. I reach up and turn on the light just above me, it 's dim and wo n't be seen from the outside. “You 'll be okay, we 're safe in here. What is your moms number ?” I dial the number, it rings once and goes to voicemail. I redial and it 's picked up immediately. “Who” “I have your son .” Probably not the best choice of words at the moment. “We 're okay, he 's safe. I need you to go behind the gravatron .” “Thank god, okay where..” “You 'll see one section with no paneling along the bottom .” POP “Crawl under the ride .” I upen the hatch and stick my head inside. Two large shadows duck below the ride and I wave my phone to get their attention. “I think it 's over. There are cops .” I help the man and woman up through the hatch. The young couple follow on their own. “It seemed safer to stay .” “You said there were cops ?” “Yeah, I could see the lights. I think it 's over .” says the boyfriend. I drop through the hatch and crawl towards the front of the ride. Peering through a crack between a panel and the deck I see the flashing lights.

He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort. He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was. His investigation was n't entirely fruitless, he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka. It was cheap but would definitely get the job done. Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up. There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself.

Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there. He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done, but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money.

Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor. His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room. The window was smashed. He looked at the bottle, confused. No, he had n't done that. At least not with the vodka. He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth.

His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room. The window was smashed. He looked at the bottle, confused. No, he had n't done that. At least not with the vodka. He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth. The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place. What the fuck happened last night?"

Story: Flares danced over her burnt retina. Tinnitus shrieked in her ears. She had only wanted to make soup. Tuesday Soup. It was a soup she 'd made before, dozens of times, from the sad carcass of the Saturday chicken after Sunday chicken curry and Monday chicken pasta. This was the first time it had exploded though. There was carpet of grey dust over the olive green tiles; it turned the pallid brown of unfinished tea into a sooty black. It gripped at her lungs as she coughed on the floor. The detonation of her dinner had smashed her against the wall, and now she rose to a crawl, blind and deaf, retching the fine grit out of her throat. Above her, October 's retriever puppy was grinning stupidly from the calendar through the smog. Where she had stood, some mighty hand had burst through the ground, gripped at her oven, clenched at and crushed it. It had broken metal and stone and ceramic and torn viciously back into the floor below, leaving a great dark fissure hanging in the air. Her head felt like an old tire, worn and over pressure, that had run across a nail in the road and burst open. But she wiped the dirt from her eyes onto the sleeve of her overalls and looked up. The laceration loomed above her. As she stared at it, she saw in the black shimmers of light she could not focus on, like a scene reflected in drops of falling mercury. Around the edges of the tatter, wisps of shadow were curling off and falling to the floor. They drifted towards her, sinister leaves on the wind in a still room. Though her thoughts buzzed with pain and confusion and her vision was blurred by the impact and debris still hanging in the air, she gazed at the fissure and her breathing slowed. The dust had settled before she moved again. One quivering arm was placed ahead, and she shifted her weight from tired hip to tired shoulder and pushed a knee forward. The fissure still hung, placid and expectant, so she decided to move closer again; another hand, another knee. And again. It was within reach now, and she lifted her arm tenderly. As her finger brushed against the black, ice rolled down her back, waves from the fissure raced down her torso, hands gripped all over her skin, nails dug in and yanked hard. She was thrown into the void. She was sick, there was acid in her mouth, she was blind again and spinning and burning. Her ears were ringing. Her body was crumpled against the wall again, in the same small kitchen, with the same dust and shattered oven. The same dark tatter hanging tranquil in the corner. September’s poodle grinned stupidly from the calendar through the smog. -- - The last room she would ever see was as clean and bare as the last hall she would ever walk down, and the last room she would ever sleep in. She was strapped tight to the steel chair, gazing at the whitewashed concrete. Her last day was not much different to the days before it: a rush of strong men in black suits, cold men in white lab coats. They moved briskly but had the speed of a routine followed regularly, not the haste of a group thrown into chaos. Her last thoughts were not much different to those of the day before either. “how did they find me? Isn’t it strange how your luck can change so quickly ...”"

My life was a mess, I lost everything because of my addiction, my home, my friends, my dignity. The way people see me and talk to me is always a simple look, never looking me in the eyes. I smelled and look dirty with old sweaters and a unshaven beard. But everything changed when an old man in a suit, approached me with a kind hearten smile. He passed me a total of $ 1000. “Sir, this is far too much, I can not take this money .” “Keep it, you need this more then me, just promise me you do something with it, and make a difference .” And with that he walked away. I did n't know who he was, much less know his name. But that was the moment in my life, where I cried for what felt like hours, that I needed to do something, I needed to change. So I used that money to get a suit, a shave, a hotel room ( with a shower ), and a used cellphone and laptop. And here I am today, as one of the top journalist in the city. But I always wanted to do something, like what that old man showed me, help someone that needed it, and help them get what they dreamed. So over the weekend I dressed up as a homeless man, and went prowling the streets. Almost nobody cared about me when I asked for change, some even scolded me that I should get a job. But then as I was walking across what seemed to be an old, abandoned shop, the door opened. A Young man, Probably only in his 20 's, came out and gave me the widest smile I had seen all day. He invited me in and served me up a bowl of soup, free of charge. From what I observed, the paint was peeling off the wall of the place, the place could barely feet 20 people, and nobody else was working there except for him. He talked to me and asked me how well I am holding up out there. I was amazed at his generosity, and that smile on his face never fazed. But when I asked him about his place, His face saddened a little. “My dream was always to start a restaurant, But both my parents disagreed. When I decided I was not going to go to college, and instead focus on my business, they kicked me out .” he sadly said. He said he barely had enough to buy this place and rent a small one room flat. “But I had few to almost zero customers, I know I 'm no five star restaurant cook, but I know how to cook a mean grilled steak .” he laughed silently at himself. But he said that was n't enough, he had nobody sending in work resumes, no customers, and his bills on everything was already in the red. “Owning a restaurant is all I ever dream about, but the way things are now, I know I 'm going to fail, but I just want to be at least given a chance, you know? To show this world what I 'm made of, and make a difference .” I thank him for the meal, and walked out of the place, before he could see any of the tears on my face. And so you have it people, an honest man just trying to keep his dream alive. And I 'm going to make that dream happen, I 'm going to be going to that restaurant for breakfast today as well as a signing event, I hope as many people can make it, cause I 'm not gon na lie, that soup was n't half bad.

Story: Part 2 - One specific day changed everything. One day I bought a Hawaiian shirt. Bright, loud, expressive colours. I genuinely believed I was to become someone who could n't afford taste when it came to fashion, but I could not have been more wrong. I became Damien Black. Damien was a mid-thirties, ridiculously successful, masculine heart throb. Chiselled body, dashing good looks and the perfect man if ever I 'd seen one. I had more money than I could dream of and I was better looking. I swear to god my sense of humour improved too. Suddenly I was surrounded by a posse of women as my escort. Sure, the Hawaiian shirt was difficult to explain at times, but boy did I not care. I developed one hell of a Cocaine habit as Damien, it 's where most of the poor bastards money went. Before I knew it I, Damien, was broke. I could n't stop the high life though. I 'd tasted the 2 % of the world and I was not ready to give it up. As Damien I 'd had contact with some of the worlds richest men. I knew where they were and where they liked to go, I knew where they lived and their partners names. Before I knew it I was driving cross country to commandeer these peoples lives. I would try and get close to them, but as a nobody that 's pretty difficult. So I started breaking into their houses, stealing their lives. Money, power and the high-life was my heroin. When I was n't someone else I was nobody. I could n't even remember my name, my age or where I lived. Memories faded to black. Ray had always kept in regular contact in the seven years since he had came into my room and saved my life. Often he 'd talk to me about what I was doing, he 'd give me advice and I 'd generally brush it under the carpet. He was a Demon after all, he was sure to lead me down the wrong path eventually. But this time when Ray came to me things were different. “Look, Kid, I 'm taking you ability away from you.” “What! You ca n't, Ray! Please! ” I shouted like a child who had been told their favourite toy was about to go in the bin. “It 's time Kid, you 're done. It 's time to be yourself now.” “But I do n't even know who I am anymore, Ray. Why would you do this to me? ” “Then it 's perfect – you do n't know who you are, so be whoever YOU want to be! Look, Kid, I 've not been honest with you. I 'm not a Demon. I 'm an Angel. I came to you that day to save you. I gave you an ability so you could see the world and understand that your life compared to others is unique. You are yourself, you are one in however many billion. You took that for granted and were ready to throw that away.” “But I 've missed so much of my life, Ray. I never completed college, I lost my friends, my family, everything” . “And I 'll give it all back to you. I just need you to understand that no matter what life gives you, no matter how low or insecure you feel, you are unique. There is no one else in the world like you. Everyone has their battles, but we find ways in life to overcome our struggles, Kid. We fight. We seek help to fight. We seek support. We support others. You have one life, make the most of it instead of trying to live your life being someone else. Be who you want to be.” By this point I was an emotional wreck. Somehow, amidst all the tears and snot streaming down my face I managed to barely make a response. “OK, Ray. I understand. So what now? ”. I closed my eyes for only a moment and I was back in my room. I was stood on the chair, noose around my neck, ready to end it all. Ray was n't there. I stepped off the chair, took down the rope and sat on my bed, where Ray had sat seven years ago. As I sat there I saw something out the corner of my eye. Atop my desk was a note, from Ray. “Be yourself, Kid. – Ray” . I 'd spent a long time being someone else, so much so that I had forgotten who I was and what made me unique. The adventures I had, the places I 've travelled and the world I had seen were enough to make any man jealous, but it was always as someone else. Now was the time to finally be myself, to accept the flaws, the imperfections and remember what makes me myself."

I never remember my dreams, so I even kept a notebook beside the bed so that I could write down what happened. I 'm not sure where I was; the few moments I had to look around as I threw the furs off the bed and walked in my pyjamas to the thumping door showed me I was in a small wooden house, not much more than a bed, a table, and a few chairs, a lamp ... cozy, I remember thinking. It 's really the only thought I had time for. I opened the door. A trio of men were outside. One thrust a lamp towards me briefly, and with a nod, the men on either side of him stepped forwards and seized me. I was bound at the wrists, a sack put over my head, and thrown into a half-empty hay cart, where my legs were bound as well. I 'm not sure how long we traveled, it felt like an eternity; I could feel a breeze and the quiet hooting of an owl, a few pinpricks of light through the sack from the full moon. The cart stops; I am hauled out of the hay, my ankles unbound, and walked through a winding maze of corridors and passages. A door creaks, the sound of metal on metal, the hood removed, and I am shoved inside to land on my left shoulder with enough time to watch the door pulled shut and locked by a guard. Sleep is elusive. Instead, I watch the blue-blacks turn to purple, to red, then orange. Just as the blues creep into the barred window are there footsteps. Men with swords have come for me. I am allowed to see the corridors I am led through now, out to the rear of what I now know is a castle, to the fairgrounds. People are grouped in a half circle around a large pole jutting from the ground, around which furniture and wood has been piled. In the center of the half circle is a raised box dressed in purples and reds and yellows where a man and a woman sit in relative shade, as I am lead and tied to the pole. The rope binds uncomfortably against my breasts, tightly, as men with more wood come to place it around my feet. The man in the box nods. Two men with swords and torches set the wood alight. I remember looking up at a lone bird flying through the air as the wood catches and begins to smoke; oh, to be a bird, free from restraint and tyranny. As the heat of the flames draws closer to my ankles, a noise pierces the sky, and I wake to the sound of my alarm clock, soaked in sweat, and I and everything in my bed reeks of pine smoke. I did n't need the notebook."

Story: The first evidence of life beyond that humans were to be treated to, consisted of huge, intricate, metallic structures dropped by parachute, and gently wafting down to the earth. But once ensconced, these origamic beauties created Einstein-Rosen Bridges that disgorged hordes of arachnid shock troops, in an alien invasion that nearly ended us. I was too young to have lived through the Teegardener War, but I 've seen old-style video clips in school. They were lightning fast, incredibly intelligent, and unmatched in their ability to improvise weaponry. They did n't come with fancy guns, bombs, swords, or powered armor. It was just them, naked as the day they were spawned, streaming out of their tripod wormholes. It was to their great fortune, and not ours, that their first wave randomly landed in southern Africa. It was pure dumb bad luck. If, say, they had started in the heart of the European Union, North America, or heck, even urban China, we might have stood a chance. But we lost too much ground, too fast. Before most of the planet was aware of the danger, they already had a sizable foothold, had consolidated and fortified their initial gains, and had already figured out how to fly our aircraft. All those unscheduled flights out of Johannesburg, Pretoria, and the Congo should have tipped off someone -- but those flights were “only” going to other places no-one cared about: Brazil, other towns in Africa, Yemen, India. As well, where the Teegardeners went, the grey goo weapons we first tried to deploy, but they co-opted from us were not far behind, finishing off the campaign of decimation their soldiers had begun. The news of invasion in the developed world began with talking about South Africa in the past tense, along with cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Mogadishu. The Teegardeners marched up the Southern Hemisphere into the North, scouring the helpless Earth of its air-breathing masters, trampling every city and nation and grinding human civilization into the dust. Only the undersea nations and colonies of the world, the newest members of the United Nations, were left relatively unscathed. They had chosen us to be the messenger of doom to future generations of survivors. In one hundred of our years, they said, the second wave would arrive to finish off the race of men. After eleven tense days, they had evacuated their surviving forces back across their star bridges which deactivated and were left completely inert after them, perhaps to serve as monuments to their victory. And perhaps to serve as ever-present insults and taunts for the unborn generation they would someday come back to annihilate. They must have never thought we could figure out how their star bridges worked, but we did. In fact, we were always “just twenty years away” from a lot of fantastic inventions that promised to save mankind from its own vices. But their portals provided the missing links that were needed in so many different fields. In my generation, we were supposed to fear and tremble at the hundred-year problem. But my generation solved it. When the Teegardeners come back, they will not just have to fight us. They will have to fight our friends: The Altairans, the Reticulans, the Kellerites, the Risatas, the Cuttlefins, and all the other alien species which the Teegardners have bullied and threatened and pillaged for millennia. They will have to fight all the allied races we made contact with using their own star bridges, once we understood how they worked. I ca n't sleep. I ca n't wait. I 'm looking forward to the end of the hundred-year problem. It 's not what the Teegardeners wanted, but it 's what they 're going to get. The Aries Terror ends here, on Earth, tomorrow. The Coalition will be waiting for them."

They had chosen us to be the messenger of doom to future generations of survivors. In one hundred of our years, they said, the second wave would arrive to finish off the race of men. After eleven tense days, they had evacuated their surviving forces back across their star bridges which deactivated and were left completely inert after them, perhaps to serve as monuments to their victory. And perhaps to serve as ever-present insults and taunts for the unborn generation they would someday come back to annihilate. They must have never thought we could figure out how their star bridges worked, but we did. In fact, we were always “just twenty years away” from a lot of fantastic inventions that promised to save mankind from its own vices. But their portals provided the missing links that were needed in so many different fields. In my generation, we were supposed to fear and tremble at the hundred-year problem. But my generation solved it. When the Teegardeners come back, they will not just have to fight us. They will have to fight our friends: The Altairans, the Reticulans, the Kellerites, the Risatas, the Cuttlefins, and all the other alien species which the Teegardners have bullied and threatened and pillaged for millennia. They will have to fight all the allied races we made contact with using their own star bridges, once we understood how they worked. I ca n't sleep. I ca n't wait. I 'm looking forward to the end of the hundred-year problem. It 's not what the Teegardeners wanted, but it 's what they 're going to get. The Aries Terror ends here, on Earth, tomorrow.

Story: The first evidence of life beyond that humans were to be treated to, consisted of huge, intricate, metallic structures dropped by parachute, and gently wafting down to the earth. But once ensconced, these origamic beauties created Einstein-Rosen Bridges that disgorged hordes of arachnid shock troops, in an alien invasion that nearly ended us. I was too young to have lived through the Teegardener War, but I 've seen old-style video clips in school. They were lightning fast, incredibly intelligent, and unmatched in their ability to improvise weaponry. They did n't come with fancy guns, bombs, swords, or powered armor. It was just them, naked as the day they were spawned, streaming out of their tripod wormholes. It was to their great fortune, and not ours, that their first wave randomly landed in southern Africa. It was pure dumb bad luck. If, say, they had started in the heart of the European Union, North America, or heck, even urban China, we might have stood a chance. But we lost too much ground, too fast.

Story: “IT WAS A MISTAKE !” I yelled to the universe. Angry at everyone. Angry at no one. I was angry at no one but myself. I clenched my fists and fell on my knees my yell reverberating through the dark alleyway i found myself in. The gravel barely stung. Tears started to fall and in the cold of the night, in the privacy of the darkness I succumbed to every emotion eroding their way through me. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. A blurry image, I blinked and I saw a shadow of a man hidden behind a large dumpster. He could have beaten me, could have mugged me, even killed me and I would have let it happen. Nothing mattered anymore. “Dude ...” His raspy voice called to me “..you okay ?” I looked over to see him wrapped in dirty old blankets, his hair matted and greasy. He looked at me with cold sunken eyes his cheekbones protruding from his face. He stretched out a skinny bony hand to crouch next to me. He reeked. “I had everything ...” I whispered. I felt my lip tremble. I sobbed in front of this stranger. “Wot cha mean ?” He asked leaning closer until I could count every strand of hair on his eyebrows, could smell the dirty crumbs of food leftover on his beard. I swallowed. “I wished for wealth ... I wished for love ... I wished for health ...” I rolled over onto the ground glancing at the sky above me, murky water splashing on my once pristine suit. “I wish for an end ... .” High above me, millions of miles away, a lone star shimmered down at me from a blanket of darkness daring to dazzle the polluted atmosphere of the city. “Yo, man them sum good wishes! Do n't got ta wish for an end, do n't got ta think that way ...” He plopped himself down cross-legged beside me his dirty bare feet wriggling as he spoke, “How 'd you wish for them wishes anyway? Dey come tru ?” A cruel laugh escaped me. “I 'm an idiot, I was happy I was doing well for myself but I had to ruin everything with those fucking wishes .” The hobo tilted his head. “Wot happened ?” “I was rich beyond belief ... my ... my wife ...” another sob at the memory of her. “.. my wife and my children .” We both turned as a police car drove by the alleyway, lights flashing, the shrill siren upsetting the night. “Everything came at a price ... “I continued. I sniffled wiping away snot. “Wait, here. Hav a drink” the hobo pulled a large flask from under his blankets and shook it in front of my face. Without hesitation I grabbed it and took a large swig the alcohol burning slightly down my throat. I handed back the flask. “My son was killed in an accident. I-We were devistated ... at first. It was n't just him, his whole class died. It was horrible ... but then came money came. It was compensation. At first from the school, then from the district and it kept going until at the end we were receiving checks from the mayor himself. I knew it was because of my wish ...

We tried to forget, we traveled and spent the money to try to buy our happiness but it was impossible. My wife and my beautiful 15-year-old daughter were depressed. Even I was depressed.

Story: **Kuhio Highway** “Let’s pick up the next hitchhiker, ” I say. I’m venturing out because I’ve never told him that I think picking up hitchhikers is an awesome thing to do. So many people think every hitchhiker is a potential serial killer that is going to attack you while you’re driving. “Yeah, that sounds fun, ” my husband says. I 'm so happy I did n't even have to convince him. We were driving down Kuhio Hwy from Hanalei to Poipu Beach. Kauai was the best vacation we’d ever had so far. We stopped in every town, looking for the authentic Hawaiian experience, hitting antique shops and small diners. We even stopped at a house off the highway where a family was selling barbeque in their front yard. “There’s one, ” he said. “That didn’t take long, ” I say and smile. I pull over and my husband rolls down his window. “Hop in, ” he says. He doesn’t bother with asking where the guy is heading. There’s one highway in Kauai and we’re heading his direction. We do the first bits of small talk - Hi. How you doing? Where you heading? – before we go into asking about the guy’s life and what brought him to Kauai in the first place. “It’s a long story if you have time to hear it, ” he says. “We’ve got another hour on this road – we’re your audience for the next hour, ” I say. As he talks, the hitchhiker grows more and more tired. He tells us his life story, from the start of high school through his next 40 years. He’s been a criminal, a fighter, a husband, a father and now a Christian missionary, selling books about Jesus. By the time we get to the end of his story, he’s slipping into sleep. My husband and I are feeling more awake and refreshed with every minute we listen. After the hitchhiker curls up and falls to sleep, I look at my husband. “Let’s drop him off at a church – he’s a missionary, after all, ” my husband says. We drive a few more miles until we see a small, wooden church right off of the highway. It has a shaded overhang and a bench out front. “This looks nice, ” I say and pull over. My husband opens the back door of the car and shakes the missionary awake. The missionary looks at him groggily. “What was I saying? ” he asks. Then he looks at my husband and says, “Hey, where am I? Umm…do I know you? ” “Come on, big guy, ” my husband says. “This is your stop.” My husband helps him out of the car and walks him over to the bench. I can overhear the missionary saying, “I can’t remember anything, right now. Did I drink? I can’t even remember my name.” My husband gives the man a few reassuring pats and walks back to the car. “That was very tasty, ” he says when he returns to the car. “Hitchhikers are the best. I’m so glad you agreed to pick one up. They all have such great, long stories, so many memories to eat, ” I say. “Yeah, it’s so much better than spending hours at a bar, getting little memories like appetizers, ” he says. “Let’s pick one up on our way to Waimea Canyon tomorrow. It’ll be nice to hike on a full stomach.” Yep, I love Kauai – people are so kind and open here. This vacation is going to be the best ever."

It’ll be nice to hike on a full stomach.” Yep, I love Kauai – people are so kind and open here. This vacation is going to be the best ever."

Story: **Kuhio Highway** “Let’s pick up the next hitchhiker, ” I say. I’m venturing out because I’ve never told him that I think picking up hitchhikers is an awesome thing to do. So many people think every hitchhiker is a potential serial killer that is going to attack you while you’re driving. “Yeah, that sounds fun, ” my husband says. I 'm so happy I did n't even have to convince him. We were driving down Kuhio Hwy from Hanalei to Poipu Beach. Kauai was the best vacation we’d ever had so far. We stopped in every town, looking for the authentic Hawaiian experience, hitting antique shops and small diners. We even stopped at a house off the highway where a family was selling barbeque in their front yard. “There’s one, ” he said. “That didn’t take long, ” I say and smile. I pull over and my husband rolls down his window. “Hop in, ” he says. He doesn’t bother with asking where the guy is heading. There’s one highway in Kauai and we’re heading his direction. We do the first bits of small talk - Hi. How you doing? Where you heading? – before we go into asking about the guy’s life and what brought him to Kauai in the first place. “It’s a long story if you have time to hear it, ” he says. “We’ve got another hour on this road – we’re your audience for the next hour, ” I say. As he talks, the hitchhiker grows more and more tired. He tells us his life story, from the start of high school through his next 40 years. He’s been a criminal, a fighter, a husband, a father and now a Christian missionary, selling books about Jesus. By the time we get to the end of his story, he’s slipping into sleep. My husband and I are feeling more awake and refreshed with every minute we listen. After the hitchhiker curls up and falls to sleep, I look at my husband. “Let’s drop him off at a church – he’s a missionary, after all, ” my husband says. We drive a few more miles until we see a small, wooden church right off of the highway. It has a shaded overhang and a bench out front. “This looks nice, ” I say and pull over. My husband opens the back door of the car and shakes the missionary awake. The missionary looks at him groggily. “What was I saying? ” he asks. Then he looks at my husband and says, “Hey, where am I? Umm…do I know you? ” “Come on, big guy, ” my husband says. “This is your stop.” My husband helps him out of the car and walks him over to the bench. I can overhear the missionary saying, “I can’t remember anything, right now. Did I drink? I can’t even remember my name.” My husband gives the man a few reassuring pats and walks back to the car. “That was very tasty, ” he says when he returns to the car. “Hitchhikers are the best. I’m so glad you agreed to pick one up.

Story: I feel like I 'm in a museum, looking at the strange, old echoes of a world I ca n't seem to fully understand. Feelings of old people, sadness that 's creeped up in paint, veneer, wrinkled skin. Such stillness. Minds you just ca n't reach, that are always behind the horizon. I thought I would feel repulsed but I do n't, my beliefs in the world are only slightly hampered, and only temporarily. Somewhere on the edge of my mind is the tendency to blame it on capitalism. As if socialism were any better. It feels too easy. It feels like I 've been set up to make that connection. The endless documentaries and talking heads. Socialism is no better, and the truth of the matter is that we really do n't have an answer. I have this triggered sense of superiority which I loath. Mostly because it 's that: it 's triggered. I do n't have the answers, nobody does. Yet deep down I still feel I would never be so crazy as to take my own life. What were these people thinking when they did it? Did this forest somehow remind them of a museum? Did they want to make a statement? I was always thought committing suicide is an act of aggression. Did these people have a raging fire in their hearts, as they kneeled on the ground, quietly preparing their ropes, quietly setting up their tents? But the world played one last trick on them. It wiped out any sense of rage, of victory, even desperation. I only feel slightly less confident about the world I find myself in. A subtle sabotaging, an eerie, distant discomfort. My conscience is still telling me that I 'm above this, my personality is stronger, the culture I find myself in is more sane, I 'm more rational, my political beliefs are more ethical. As I keep pushing aside the involuntary thoughts I do not like, and do not perceive as truly my own, I feel I 'm getting closer to these men. I 'm starting to feel sad.

But the longer you listen this person business practices and plans for the future you find yourself wanting to help with with the assassination rather than prevent it.

Story: My first assignment with The Company was almost thirty years ago, now; I was new to contractor work and I remember being excited just to be in the field with a rifle. Excited to be part of a team of mean-looking dudes in multicam load-bearing gear, body armor, face masks. I was freshly back from overseas -- I’d been a REMF -- and wanted to feel like a badass. We were assigned to protect a mining claim in northern Wisconsin. This was of course well before the first Water War in the southwest, and the idea of heavily armed private security at a remote mineral extraction site shocked a lot of people. I remember being on the news. Between my tricked-out M4 and padded gloves and the skull facemask, I made newspapers nationwide. Above the fold. Even though the other guys teased me for letting one of the activists take my picture, I remember thinking at the time that the whole thing was fucking awesome. Who were these enviro-weenies who thought they had the right to interfere with a private mining interest on private property? In the end we’d only faced off with a few local protesters. Mostly hippies and Indians as I recall. We didn’t even carry any ammo in those days. But for a wannabe trigger-puller it was a fun summer. I did indeed feel like a badass all kitted up, walking the property perimeter with the team, some of whom were actual combat vets. Something else stuck with me from that summer. One evening I was off-duty and went for a hike along a stream near the mine site. I remember watching a particular stretch of water as the sun set, how the light seemed to climb up out of the trees and how the fish were rising, rhythmically, eating bugs that were on the water and flying around, blinking in and out of the sunbeams. It was silent, peaceful. Like they’d been doing it for a million years. Probably had been. It didn’t register then, but that stream was right downhill from the mine site. A mine site that would eventually be mothballed due to water usage restrictions, be sold off by The Company. Ten years later the neglected tailings dam would fail and dump a million tons of acidic mine waste sludge into the stream, and into Lake Superior. I did see some action with the crew during the first Water War, the southwestern one, but it was mostly defending tanker trucks heading to the frack sites from ambush -- pretty easy stuff, really. Those yahoos had no training and no arms to speak of and we just wiped them out. Didn’t even slow the trucks down, usually. Left them lying in the dust. They were slow, unorganized, predictable. Easy to hit. Wrapped up in cloth from head to foot, just like the hadjis overseas had been. Of course by that time Oklahoma was in full dust-bowl mode, aquifers bone dry, so such dress was practical. But as a child of the War on Terror period I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make pulling the trigger easier. All they had was desperation and desperation is not enough to make a successful guerrilla movement. But they didn’t have to be desperate. They could have moved to the cities or the camps with everyone else and had their water ration. Sure, the ration system was imperfect. If they hated it that much they could have just bought water from The Company. If they could afford it. Any of these would be better than bleeding out in the dust on the side of an empty highway. The Company owned the rights to that water, legal and fair. Who were they to try to take it, based on some romantic ideal of public property? But that was the first war. Not much of a war. Some minor civil unrest. The leeway that the Feds granted The Company as “Critical Infrastructure” meant that they could solve such problems as they saw fit. Fitness, to them, came from the muzzle of a mercenary’s rifle. Like mine. It also meant that I had a full hydration bladder at all times and a hot shower waiting for me in the barracks. I wasn’t complaining. Things settled down for a while. But when the second crisis developed, the fouling of the Lakes due to widespread catastrophic mine failures, we were back at work overnight. The Company had wells up in the Great Lakes sand country and, being the last sources of clean water, they were prime targets for thirsty locals.

But the longer you listen this person business practices and plans for the future you find yourself wanting to help with with the assassination rather than prevent it.

Story: My first assignment with The Company was almost thirty years ago, now; I was new to contractor work and I remember being excited just to be in the field with a rifle. Excited to be part of a team of mean-looking dudes in multicam load-bearing gear, body armor, face masks. I was freshly back from overseas -- I’d been a REMF -- and wanted to feel like a badass. We were assigned to protect a mining claim in northern Wisconsin. This was of course well before the first Water War in the southwest, and the idea of heavily armed private security at a remote mineral extraction site shocked a lot of people. I remember being on the news. Between my tricked-out M4 and padded gloves and the skull facemask, I made newspapers nationwide. Above the fold. Even though the other guys teased me for letting one of the activists take my picture, I remember thinking at the time that the whole thing was fucking awesome. Who were these enviro-weenies who thought they had the right to interfere with a private mining interest on private property? In the end we’d only faced off with a few local protesters. Mostly hippies and Indians as I recall. We didn’t even carry any ammo in those days. But for a wannabe trigger-puller it was a fun summer. I did indeed feel like a badass all kitted up, walking the property perimeter with the team, some of whom were actual combat vets. Something else stuck with me from that summer. One evening I was off-duty and went for a hike along a stream near the mine site. I remember watching a particular stretch of water as the sun set, how the light seemed to climb up out of the trees and how the fish were rising, rhythmically, eating bugs that were on the water and flying around, blinking in and out of the sunbeams. It was silent, peaceful. Like they’d been doing it for a million years. Probably had been. It didn’t register then, but that stream was right downhill from the mine site. A mine site that would eventually be mothballed due to water usage restrictions, be sold off by The Company. Ten years later the neglected tailings dam would fail and dump a million tons of acidic mine waste sludge into the stream, and into Lake Superior. I did see some action with the crew during the first Water War, the southwestern one, but it was mostly defending tanker trucks heading to the frack sites from ambush -- pretty easy stuff, really. Those yahoos had no training and no arms to speak of and we just wiped them out. Didn’t even slow the trucks down, usually. Left them lying in the dust. They were slow, unorganized, predictable. Easy to hit. Wrapped up in cloth from head to foot, just like the hadjis overseas had been. Of course by that time Oklahoma was in full dust-bowl mode, aquifers bone dry, so such dress was practical. But as a child of the War on Terror period I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make pulling the trigger easier. All they had was desperation and desperation is not enough to make a successful guerrilla movement. But they didn’t have to be desperate. They could have moved to the cities or the camps with everyone else and had their water ration. Sure, the ration system was imperfect. If they hated it that much they could have just bought water from The Company. If they could afford it. Any of these would be better than bleeding out in the dust on the side of an empty highway. The Company owned the rights to that water, legal and fair. Who were they to try to take it, based on some romantic ideal of public property? But that was the first war. Not much of a war. Some minor civil unrest. The leeway that the Feds granted The Company as “Critical Infrastructure” meant that they could solve such problems as they saw fit. Fitness, to them, came from the muzzle of a mercenary’s rifle. Like mine. It also meant that I had a full hydration bladder at all times and a hot shower waiting for me in the barracks. I wasn’t complaining. Things settled down for a while. But when the second crisis developed, the fouling of the Lakes due to widespread catastrophic mine failures, we were back at work overnight. The Company had wells up in the Great Lakes sand country and, being the last sources of clean water, they were prime targets for thirsty locals.

You keep to the wastelands as the cities of the world have turned into sewers, too rancid to even imagine. And so the people live along the muddy surface of the earth, sticking to forests when a new attack is launched. Grass does n't seem to grow anymore, nor bushes, or weeds and certainly not poppies.

Scrolls and books lay scattered across the otherwise neat floor, remains of her dad work. They would have to be cleaned up soon, but it was not yet finished. The rough fingers weaving Leila 's hair into a long braid softly touched her neck in the process, sending a slight shiver down her spine. Her mother 's hand were as cold as always, but even after all this time she had not gotten used to them. “Ah, I have to remember to let you use the rose cream when I get back from school. Your skin is all dried up !” A bland grunt from behind Leila was the only answer she got, but she understood perfectly. Communication still was a problem, but she was working on it day and night. With a slight jump, she slid from the chair, turned around and laid her book on the table. A big smile on her face, she bowed for a moment, before looking into her mothers tired eyes. The long brown hair was tousled, in desperate need of a combing themselves. But there had been no time for that lately. The girl reached for the ashen arm of the body in front of her, gently touching the rope around the wrists. “Thanks mommy !” The simple dress swinging with her every motion, Leila walked into the kitchen and grabbed a small white bundle. Inside it, so she found out by sneakily peeking for a moment, were two apples and a big sandwich waiting for her lunchtime. With the bundle stuffed in her bag, making sure it would not be squashed by the heavy books she had borrowed from the school 's library. With light steps she almost flew to the door, her mothers already waiting to see her off. Leila hugged her for a moment, but made sure for it to be a brief one. She was almost ten now, after all. With a fluid, happy motion she opened the creaking door, stepping outside. After a last wave towards the inside of the house, Leila closed the big wooden plane behind her again. She already expected the muffled thud as her mother collapsed inside the house. Another thing to work on, she noted to herself. For now she was happy enough with strolling through the little village 's street on her way to the school on the hill outside, greeting the citizens as they rose from the ground in front of her, just to collapse momentarily as soon as she had passed them.

Story: I’m so sorry. I hate myself for what I’m about to do. I hate that I was pushed to do this but the world is full of villainous people and villainous lies and I’ve found that there is no way to defeat them. There is only the hope that my actions will soften the consequences on the innocent.

This morning I awoke and I dreaded leaving bed. My stomach hurt. I felt sick. ‘ Today is not the day’I told myself. Today I will cancel everything; I will stay in bed and hold my wife. I will watch horridly colorful children’s shows with Rob and Dee dee and eat Chinese takeout despite the fact that my doctor keeps telling me to eat healthier. He insists that if I don’t take care of myself for me, that I must do it for my family. I will drink some tea to still my stomach and I will not wear a suit. Not today. And yet even as I thought this I found myself clumsily sliding out of my covers like a lame snake and shuffling to my closet. I hate these suits. They look like the type of clothes you die in. I got dressed and noted that I definitely have gained weight. I sighed. I really shouldn’t have eaten so much Chinese food. I really should have taken better care of myself. I’m not that old. Men my age still play sports and go out for runs. Perhaps I will cancel today and go for a run instead. But no. I haven’t the time. I have to stop being childish and put away childish things. Tomorrow will be too late. ... ... ... ... .... I left the house. I barely remember seeing Joanne as I left and it was only an hour ago. She looked worried. She always looked worried now a days though. This is a worrisome world we live in. I wish she wouldn’t worry. I wish I stayed home with her. I wish I could tell her again how much I love her. I do love her. We fight too much. I wish I spent less time eating Chinese food and fighting and more time running and loving her. It was always just stress though. She always supports me when I need her most. I love her and I know she always knew. And here I am at work. Here I am in a room full of people. To speak to them all and to deliver them their share of work. Yes, there were villains at work but it was not these people. If I am lucky they will, in fact, be the first instruments of many to expose the warts of this system and deliver it from evil. This is a battle I can not turn away from and I will not turn away from. On this day I will kill a false villain, a scape goat, an innocent, in order to expose a great, obscured villain. I wish it were just one man. He would be easy to catch. It’s so much harder when the villains live in the cracks. It’s so much harder when they are the cracks. There is no one to arrest. No one to destroy. Just slow and painful steps towards correction. Like the steps I took when I left my bed. An innocent man dies today and a Villain is exposed. It’s a terrible responsibility I find myself burdened with. ... ... ... ... .... I step behind the podium and speak. Men and woman take notes, hold cameras, and watch. They look bored and confused and I’m sweating profusely and I’m scared they won’t understand. They must understand. That is the only way we will, in the coming months and years, develop a true Justice System here in the United States. That is the only way we will triumph over evil. If all is for not then the villain will reign supreme. I speak and my mind wanders. I continue speaking and speaking but my mind is not here and I think that maybe staying home was a good idea after all. I think that Chinese food sounds like such a wonderful idea. I think that I truly and dearly hope that the sacrifice of my life is not in vain. And then I pull the revolver from my manila work envelope and I warn those around me to please stay back. They might get hurt. I don’t want anyone else to get hurt but there is such an uproar in the room right now. I am doing such a terrible despicable thing, but if they find me innocent perhaps we can begin, as a nation, to repair the cracks of the Justice system. Maybe we can start to destroy this villain.

Story: Airman crashed through the ceiling of the latest secret lair of The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived. He used his control of the atmosphere to instantly lower the pressure in the space, causing the pair of minions who were cleaning their laser rifles to collapse out of lack of oxygen. He landed on the concrete floor, tucking and rolling to reduce the strain on his legs. Airman was n't a young vigilante any more. He hopped to his feet, scanning the space for any threats that could n't be disabled by a change in the air. Airman was relieved to find none. He raised the pressure back to normal to prevent accidently suffocating the minions. At the other end of the building he spotted his arch nemesis, The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived. “Dang it man !” Said The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived, rather exasperated, “Why do you always have to come through the celling .” Airman pondered the question. Admittedly he could have come through either of the walls, they were as decrepit as the ceiling. Airman could never understand The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived 's obsession with using abandoned warehouses as his “secret” lairs. “I should have had a trap ready for you, but you 'd probably just escape instantly, or I could have had a laser ready to vaporize you, or ...” he trailed off. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived slumped into a chair and placed his helmeted head in his hands. “I 'm just not feeling it today man. to tell you the truth I have n't been felling it at all recently. Maybe I should get out of the business .” Airman was horrified. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived was the only active villain in the entire country. Everyone else had either been busted or got out of the game a while ago. If this went on any longer Airman would soon be out of a job.

Airman had no idea where that came from but he did have the beginnings of an idea forming in the back of his head. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived looked up.

Story: Airman crashed through the ceiling of the latest secret lair of The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived. He used his control of the atmosphere to instantly lower the pressure in the space, causing the pair of minions who were cleaning their laser rifles to collapse out of lack of oxygen. He landed on the concrete floor, tucking and rolling to reduce the strain on his legs. Airman was n't a young vigilante any more. He hopped to his feet, scanning the space for any threats that could n't be disabled by a change in the air. Airman was relieved to find none. He raised the pressure back to normal to prevent accidently suffocating the minions. At the other end of the building he spotted his arch nemesis, The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived. “Dang it man !” Said The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived, rather exasperated, “Why do you always have to come through the celling .” Airman pondered the question. Admittedly he could have come through either of the walls, they were as decrepit as the ceiling. Airman could never understand The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived 's obsession with using abandoned warehouses as his “secret” lairs. “I should have had a trap ready for you, but you 'd probably just escape instantly, or I could have had a laser ready to vaporize you, or ...” he trailed off. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived slumped into a chair and placed his helmeted head in his hands. “I 'm just not feeling it today man. to tell you the truth I have n't been felling it at all recently. Maybe I should get out of the business .” Airman was horrified. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived was the only active villain in the entire country. Everyone else had either been busted or got out of the game a while ago. If this went on any longer Airman would soon be out of a job.

The land is something of a collective conciseness, those who go mad in four dimensional space eventually find one another and able to see every nuance of each other eventually merge. The merge also spreads the physicality of the consciousness over all of fourth dimensional space, a false projection of three dimensional space on a 4 dimensional substrate like a projector for a movie. “I 'm thinking that you would do to not look inside my brain .” The Land chuckled, “Why?

Story: The sand was warm. So was the air, and so was the wind. Everything was comfortably warm and cozy. The body of water - not sure what it was exactly - was sloshing lazily, entrancing me with it 's soft melody. Everything was in the tints of yellow and orange - the setting sun appeared larger than usually, and seemed static for now. I had my sweetheart laying next to me, nuzzling her head in the curve of my neck. She was warm, too, and her touch had a little something special to it. It was not just like touching - it felt almost electric. But not vibrating electric - the touch radiated energetic comfort and security. Everything was quiet except for the water and wind. For once, everything was perfect. It never happened, and it might never happen, but damn it feels good to have a bit of sunshine to go back to sometimes, even though in the end it just makes me feel slightly more miserable when I wake. I have a few more I could describe too. My life was too uneventful to remember a lot of things, but there are a few events that stand out. A few more dreams that have been etched into memories too. Not all of them as nice."

Story: She likes this part of the convent. It was quiet, free from the other sisters. It was easier to meditate here. She had a lot to meditate on. Her life had n't been easy. She was born in a town whose name escaped her to parents who left her in a world where her value was determined by what was between her legs. She had n't minded being a prostitute, not really. It was better than the uglier girls got, working on the streets to sell day old meat and rotten vegetables. Her room in the brothel had the same posters of movie stars that any other teenager her age had had. The only difference had been the constant stream of men- some she admired and some she had hated. The doctor who would tip her an extra ruble was her favorite- he would give her medicine or shots in exchange for favors. Her least favorite was the drunkard- he smelled like a fish and made her do disgusting things. Of course, she had her issues too- the old women who would shake their heads as she walked past them on the streets or the men who would catcall her. She became dissatisfied with her life, with the shame she felt. She happened upon a church one day, and came in because it was quiet. No noises. Nobody looking at her. It was just her and her god there. Her thoughts were interrupted by the large chapel door opening. Her head turned quickly toward the sound, and her eyes met those of an initiate priest. He looked at her, startled, like a rabbit seeing a hawk. “Oh, I 'm sorry, I um ...” “Please, it is fine .” she responded calmly, in her best English. The young man came over to the pew where she was kneeling, and stood next to her for a moment. “Um ... may I ... ?” he asked. She nodded. “My name is Brother Peter .” he introduced himself. “I am Sister Maria .” she looked at him. His hand was outstretched, for what reason she did n't know. His hand wilted after a moment, like a flower after a spring frost. “Your English is very good .” he attempted at conversation. She sighed, realizing that this man would not leave her be. “I learned it here, in the convent. The Mother Superior is a Scot ,” she explained. “Oh. I was born in England .” Peter sat down next to her. “I 'm supposed to be visiting a priest here, to evaluate if I 'm ready to take my vows .” “There are n't any priests in convents, unfortunately for you ,” she looked at him, studying him. He had earnest blue eyes, still wide and hopeful. “Why are you here, Peter ?” she asked. “Um ... I got lost .” he began. “Really lost. I was asking a man here how to find the monastery, but I did n't know the word for it, so I asked him where the house of the faith was. He lead me here. It 's too rainy to go back out on the road, so the Mother Superior said I could stay the night here .” “The mother is a kind woman .” Maria responded. “So what 's your story ?” “My ... story ?” She asked. “Why are you a nun ?” he asked, trying to contain an almost childlike curiosity. “I am a nun because I found God .” she told him. “Your order ... they take the names of saints, right ?” he asked. “Yes, that is true .” “Yours is Maria. Like Maria Gorietti ?” “Yes .” “Um ... the that was ...” his voice dropped to a whisper. “Raped ?” Maria looked away. “Yes .” “... why ?” Maria was taken aback, both by the man 's rudeness, and by the fact he seemed to care. Even in the convent the other sisters judged her for who she was before. Peter did n't seem to be asking her in a mean way, at least she felt. “I was a different woman before I came here. A prostitute .” “Really? Wow .” he studied her for a moment. “I mean, you are very pretty, but I have never heard of a nun that was a prostitute .” “Not many are .” “Is that why you picked Maria as your name? Because of what the men did to you ?” Maria was offended by his nosiness, but for some reason not angry. She felt ... safe? He was n't going to hurt her."

Story: The man sat behind a desk alone before me. He looked at me through tired eyes before speaking. “I have to tell someone. You 're the only one strong enough and trustworthy enough for me to tell. I 'm benevolent to all who come peacefully. I heal their injuries, cure their diseases, help them forget their pain.

Those who killed became stronger and unlocked new powers and abilities. These powers came in clusters; one type could summon the elements. Another could augment their strength and speed to superhuman levels. Another could mesmerize and control the minds of the weak. I was a prison guard, a sharpshooter on the watchtowers. It was n't long before the first set of Leveled came for the criminals locked in my facility. Unarmed and locked in cells, the prisoners would be easy prey. But I had my orders - prisoners were to be kept in, and the Leveled kept out. They were weak - no more than level 3 or 4. They died one after the other as my bullets entered their skulls. I gained 5 levels that day. Most really powerful leveled folks were one of the destructive types. Me? I had healing. A little bit of radiant infusion to weapons, quite a bit of increased strength and endurance, but mostly healing. Wounds closed, infections just cleared up. Eventually the prisoners figured out what was going on with the Change and turned on each other, and we had to put them down to prevent them from killing each other and escaping. After the prisoners were gone, the other guards left - either to hide or seek their own strength. I stayed though. I opened the place up to the weak and infirm as a refuge. Became a bit of a leader or father to them. Every time we were assaulted, our foes were captured and brought before me. I served as judge, jury, and executioner. I protect my own, and I do n't brook violence against them. And so I grew stronger. The world has thinned out now - fewer and fewer people. Those who have survived have joined clans and gangs. I heard a rumor that out west someone 's even trying to get a real city-state going. Killing does n't happen much these days. But I just keep Leveling. Lost track of how many times now - hundreds, more than anyone I 've ever heard of. My flock thinks I 'm a gift from God, a holy prophet, their righteous protector. I 'm not about to dispel that notion. My quarters in this prison turned sanctuary are in the old solitary confinement area. No one is allowed back here but me, not since I consigned myself to my plan. You see, after a couple years of Leveling my healing got stronger and stronger. I could cure cancer, bring people back from mortal wounds. Then one day a stranger showed up. He was off in the head, would n't let me examine or try to heal him. That night he killed an old lady and the next morning we did what we had to. I put a bullet in his head and his light went out forever. I felt the now-familiar surge of power as I leveled up yet again. But this time it was a little different. I felt a compulsion ... I walked up to the corpse of the man I 'd just killed and laid my hand on his chest. Power surged through me and light surrounded me and the killer opened his eyes. *Resurrection*. I 'd raised him from the dead. I let someone else put him down after that. I retreated to my quarters, mind reeling. I felt a sense of honor and duty to my flock, but this gift ... this new gift was amazing! What could I do with it? It was then that I knew how I would proceed. No one 's left to challenge me. But I keep getting stronger. No one sees me kill new victims - I even stepped down as executioner, allowing those I trust to take the lives that need to be taken. That 's why you 're my executioner, and you 're the most powerful one in this place save myself. No one knows how I keep getting stronger and stronger. But I do.

Story: There was a small summerhouse my grandfather owned ... a farm that we called our “dacha .” Most officials had a dacha, usually a simple retreat or a cottage at the outskirts of the major cities, deep into their private hunting grounds. But my grandfather, in his Western cowboy hat and a torso so often exposed that it was burnt to a hide -- he was a man who felt it necessary to work on his time off. And with the collapse of the Union, he had a lot of time off while reformations were underway. We were n't usually around enough for us to keep any livestock, so instead we planted mostly vegetables. Beets and turnips, radishes and potatoes. We had an entire section just for poppies. Fresh poppy seeds were something you could n't find anywhere else -- though my brother often warned me that I should n't eat too many, or else I 'll fall asleep forever. There was a pond beside our home and a large river within a mile 's walk in either end of the surrounding forests, so we could just gather wild river berries and hunt for fish near their banks. My brother was the one who taught me how to fish. To cut the worms in half so we have twice as many, to poke them through deep enough on the hooks so they would n't wriggle off in the water. I watched as he took his small Swiss knife and pressed it through the worm, both ends dancing feverishly, absolutely silent, in the dirt. “It does n't hurt ?” “They do n't feel anything ?” “But he looks like he 's in pain .” “It 's a worm. Do you hear him screaming? No. He does n't feel anything .” Somehow, I could never do it myself without thinking about it. I 'd turn my eyes away and just press as hard as I could until I felt the texture change, the blade cut it 's way clean through the worm. I 've wondered if my brother ever had the same thoughts. The same aversions. But he did n't seem phased. Cut. Poke. Fish. It was just ritual to him. A process. He reminded much of our grandfather in that way. Quite. Meticulous. Somehow it seemed so natural, the way he could skin a rabbit or butcher a chicken. I always felt there was something broken in me, not being able to match their standard. I always had to suspend myself, to go blank in the head and close my eyes, just cutting up worms for bait. The two of them tended to the farm, mostly. I only watered and spread out the manure. When I was finally old enough, my grandfather gave me my own apple tree, which grew beautifully for about three months. Just when it was tall enough to warrant some supports, it just stopped growing. “Did you water your tree ?” My grandfather scolded me. “Of course !” I pleaded. “I water it every day! I even gave it extra compost! I do n't know why it wo n't grow .” He clicked his teeth and shook his head back and forth at my sad little tree. “Trees do n't just stop growing, Yozhik .” He smacked the back of my head, just enough for the crack of pain to connect through. “I could have planted this in the woods and it would have grown on it 's own !” “I 'm sorry ,” I said, but I was n't sure if he even heard my whimper. “Go catch some fish, at least .” His voice was dry, but the undertone of disappointment was obvious. “Hopefully you can handle holding a stick over water .” I nodded and ran into the house. “Lyosha” I called. “We need to go fishing !” The farm was strangely positioned against the sun, so the only time it was properly lit up was when the sun was setting. There were no windows on the front end of the house, only the back, where my brother was sitting now. His hands buried, busily working, inside a burlap potato sack. The pain hit me again, but this time his smack was more sincere. “I said *you* !” Do not bother your brother with this. Lyosha looked up at me, his face serious. His eyes shone like a cat in the dark, just the light of the doorway behind me lighting up his corner. “But ... that 's the woods .” I said. “What if there 's a wolf ?” “You have a knife .” He put his hand on my back and ushered me back out the door. “My little knife ca n't kill a wolf! I 'm not stro ...” My grandfather looked down at me. I could tell his face was in anticipation of my next word"

Story: I told Dani it was because of the surgery, and I suppose I wasn’t really lying. It was a perfectly natural response when faced with your own mortality to rethink your life, and the choices you’ve made, right? I hated to hurt her like that, we’d been perfectly happy for god knows how long. I *loved* her, but after the transplant… Explaining this to the empty bottle in my hand was a little easier than explaining to Dani, it didn’t look back at me with big brown tear-filled eyes. Still, they both reminded me that I was totally alone. *Fuck. * Why did I do this to myself? I should have waited a few more months, I should have tried harder! Why did I suddenly change? It wasn’t Dani, that was for sure, she was such a constant person. I was *positive* the change happened after the surgery. It was like a light switch turning off, the moment I woke up after the transplant, I had fallen out of love. That was that. I should get outta here. Garret was letting me sleep at his place and I didn’t want to piss him off and show up drunk in the middle of the night. I probably shouldn’t be drinking at all, but if I was gunna be voluntarily destroying my life I might as well be thorough. I turned right out of habit when I left the bar, but spun right back around at the end of the block. That way was Dani’s place, not mine. Garret lived uptown so I’d have to take the bus. Checking the time on my phone, I realized the next bus wouldn’t be here for another 20 minutes, so I sat down on the bench to wait. I put my face in my hands so I could better stew in my own misery, but a soft voice startled me out of my moping, causing my heart to thump erratically. “Are you alright? ” I hadn’t even seen her there. Her dark coat blended into the night, but I realized now that she’d been waiting here since before I’d arrived. She was tiny, and obviously not a threat; I tried to calm down and slow my racing pulse. “O-oh. Eh, not really.” I answered her honestly. I just couldn’t make myself respond with the customary “fine.” She surprised me again by giving me a look of understanding, rather than one of polite concern. It seemed like she really *was* interested in my problems. “Would you like to talk about it? The bus won’t be here for a while.

I looked her in the eye for a moment, they were a bright blue, and nothing like Dani’s. Ah, *Dani. * I signed and turned away. “No, no that’s ok. I don’t need to bother you with how I’m ruining my life, ” I sighed, putting my face back in my hands. She gave a soft laugh, at that. “Take this from an outside observer: It’s tough now, but you’ll be alright in the end. As long as you still have a life, there’s hope for a future.” I peaked between my fingers at her, she met my gaze with a serious expression on her face. “Has anyone died? ” she scolded me. “... no…” I answered slowly. “Then there’s still hope.” she countered with real fierceness. I didn’t know what to say to that, she was starting to take this personally. I just stared back blankly. She hesitated for a moment, clearly embarrassed by her outburst, and ducked her head to allow her soft brown hair to obscure her face. Now I felt like it was my turn to comfort her. “A-are *you* alright? ” She looked up at me after a long moment, a small frown on her lips. Her eyes shone but she didn’t let her tears fall. “No, ” she answered evenly. “My husband died a couple months ago. When I saw you here, you-you reminded me of him.” She sighed. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have-” “No-no-no, it’s okay, ” I reassured her. “Um, how did he die, if you don’t mind telling me about it? ” I could feel my pulse quicken in anxiety. I wasn’t great at talking about this kind of stuff, especially with a stranger, but I didn’t have much of a choice. “Motorcycle accident.” She said simply. “One day he was perfectly fine"

Story: I told Dani it was because of the surgery, and I suppose I wasn’t really lying. It was a perfectly natural response when faced with your own mortality to rethink your life, and the choices you’ve made, right? I hated to hurt her like that, we’d been perfectly happy for god knows how long. I *loved* her, but after the transplant… Explaining this to the empty bottle in my hand was a little easier than explaining to Dani, it didn’t look back at me with big brown tear-filled eyes. Still, they both reminded me that I was totally alone. *Fuck. * Why did I do this to myself? I should have waited a few more months, I should have tried harder! Why did I suddenly change? It wasn’t Dani, that was for sure, she was such a constant person. I was *positive* the change happened after the surgery. It was like a light switch turning off, the moment I woke up after the transplant, I had fallen out of love. That was that. I should get outta here. Garret was letting me sleep at his place and I didn’t want to piss him off and show up drunk in the middle of the night. I probably shouldn’t be drinking at all, but if I was gunna be voluntarily destroying my life I might as well be thorough. I turned right out of habit when I left the bar, but spun right back around at the end of the block. That way was Dani’s place, not mine. Garret lived uptown so I’d have to take the bus. Checking the time on my phone, I realized the next bus wouldn’t be here for another 20 minutes, so I sat down on the bench to wait. I put my face in my hands so I could better stew in my own misery, but a soft voice startled me out of my moping, causing my heart to thump erratically. “Are you alright? ” I hadn’t even seen her there. Her dark coat blended into the night, but I realized now that she’d been waiting here since before I’d arrived. She was tiny, and obviously not a threat; I tried to calm down and slow my racing pulse. “O-oh. Eh, not really.” I answered her honestly. I just couldn’t make myself respond with the customary “fine.” She surprised me again by giving me a look of understanding, rather than one of polite concern. It seemed like she really *was* interested in my problems. “Would you like to talk about it? The bus won’t be here for a while. It might help.” She replied gently, scooting a bit closer to me on the bench. What a strangely compassionate person. I looked her in the eye for a moment, they were a bright blue, and nothing like Dani’s. Ah, *Dani. * I signed and turned away. “No, no that’s ok.

Story: Duane emerged from his parent 's basement on day 12 of the apocalypse, his neckbeard bristling. He had spent the last fortnight huddled in the cellar with all of his gear at the ready. He urged his parents to do the same, but the fools had shrugged off his warnings and had met their fate the previous day. They shouted through the basement door that they were n't feeling well and were going to try going to a hospital or a government medical camp that had been set up nearby. Their corpses were not upstairs, and Duane assumed they were now roaming the streets with the rest of the undead. Duane had studied the holy scriptures and prophecies for years. Everything from 'Dawn of the Dead'to 'The Walking Dead'and everything in between. He had played the training simulation series 'Left 4 Dead'so much it was now second nature. And when Duane had first heard reports of the spread of the sickness a fortnight ago, he had initiated phase 1 of the survival process, buying ammunition, Doritos and Monster Energy Drink in bulk, then barricading himself in the basement. But now Duane had reached the fun part of survival: Killing Zombies! Duane was clad in his favorite black trenchcoat covering his camouflage cargo shorts and 'My Little Pony't-shirt. His feathered fedora perched atop his usual long ponytail. A black, tacticool, 12-Gauge shotgun, complete with a holographic sight, flashlight and bayonet attachment was slung across his shoulders. His sidearm, a Desert Eagle, chambered in .50 caliber Action Express and loaded with jacketed hollow point ammunition, was strapped to his chest holster, it sported a laser sight and was also painted tacticool-black. In his backpack, he had a week 's supply worth of beef jerky and Monster Energy Drink as well as several hundred rounds of extra ammo. But the most attention grabbing piece of Duane 's getup was the large Katana in his hand, his most prized possession. Duane had saved up a month 's worth of pay from his job at the local Hibachi grill before he could afford to buy the 'genuine'Masamune replica from the sword shop at the local shopping mall. Duane entered the street in front of his parents house to find it deserted, as expected. The power had been out for a week and he had been unable to pick up any radio channels on his emergency radio for the last week. He set a steady pace towards the shopping mall, hoping that survivors had found safety in the defensible structure. A half hour into his trek, he had to stop and rest against an abandoned car. It had been years since he had walked this far in one go. He had another thirty minutes before he would near the shopping mall. Once again, he struck off, intent to reach the mall before sundown. Anther fifteen minutes passed and Duane saw a figure on the horizon, Duane could tell by their even gait that this was a human and not a zombie. “Fuck, I 'm tired. I 'll just wait here .” Duane mumbled aloud. He unholstered the Desert Eagle and switched on the laser sight. Duane watched as a man approached him, his footfalls growing slower and slower as he approached. “Greetings gentlesir !” Duane called out. “Uh ... hi .” The man slowed to a stop, about twenty feet from Duane, looking suspicious. “Have you seen any zombies ?” Duane asked. “... any what ?” The man said, eyes darting between the giant pistol in Duane 's right hand and the Katana in his left. “Zom-Bies ...” Duane enunciated. “... Zombies ?” The man asked. Duane gaped at the man dumbfounded. How had this fool managed to survive for 12 whole days? He was n't even carrying any weapons or survival gear. “Zombies! You know, the walking dead? I 've been in my bunker the last few days, so I do n't know what you all are calling them up here .” The man just stared at him. Duane suspected the man was playing stupid and that this was a trick of some kind, so he broke into a half-sprint, running past the man and continuing towards the mall. It was n't long before he encountered another person, but finally, Duane felt his destiny as a Zombie Hunter was about to take off: this person was wearing a HazMat suit and would likely be knowledgeable about Zombies. He stopped short about 15 feet from the HazMat worker before doubling over to catch his breath. “Sir! Are you okay? !? !” The HazMat worker asked. Duane held up his index finger as if to say, 'just a sec, 'and continued panting heavily. Finally, his breath caught, he righted himself and faced the HazMat worker. He could see through the transparent mask that the HazMat worker was, in fact, an attractive female. “Sweet !” Duane thought to himself. “This"

Story: Duane emerged from his parent 's basement on day 12 of the apocalypse, his neckbeard bristling. He had spent the last fortnight huddled in the cellar with all of his gear at the ready. He urged his parents to do the same, but the fools had shrugged off his warnings and had met their fate the previous day. They shouted through the basement door that they were n't feeling well and were going to try going to a hospital or a government medical camp that had been set up nearby. Their corpses were not upstairs, and Duane assumed they were now roaming the streets with the rest of the undead. Duane had studied the holy scriptures and prophecies for years. Everything from 'Dawn of the Dead'to 'The Walking Dead'and everything in between. He had played the training simulation series 'Left 4 Dead'so much it was now second nature. And when Duane had first heard reports of the spread of the sickness a fortnight ago, he had initiated phase 1 of the survival process, buying ammunition, Doritos and Monster Energy Drink in bulk, then barricading himself in the basement. But now Duane had reached the fun part of survival: Killing Zombies! Duane was clad in his favorite black trenchcoat covering his camouflage cargo shorts and 'My Little Pony't-shirt. His feathered fedora perched atop his usual long ponytail. A black, tacticool, 12-Gauge shotgun, complete with a holographic sight, flashlight and bayonet attachment was slung across his shoulders. His sidearm, a Desert Eagle, chambered in .50 caliber Action Express and loaded with jacketed hollow point ammunition, was strapped to his chest holster, it sported a laser sight and was also painted tacticool-black. In his backpack, he had a week 's supply worth of beef jerky and Monster Energy Drink as well as several hundred rounds of extra ammo.

Story: In an quiet throne room made of old stone and dressed in fresh blood, Casper and the Gray Emperor regarded one another with weary resignation. “In the end ,” said the Gray Emperor, groaning as he lowered his weight down to the simple, steel throne, “I could n't save anyone. And perhaps I never should have tried .” “*Saved* ?” The word was bitter and bile in Casper 's mouth. “Have you any idea of the lives you 've taken? The blood you 've spilled ?” “Yes, yes, of course .” The Emperor swept a thin hand down across the dais. “There. Penbrook. My most honorable man-at-arms. He was a smithy when I met him, if you can believe that. A good one, as well. A good *man*. Four children. Beautiful, courageous Eileen back home. He loved darts. Had no taste for gambling. Painted. Worried about my health. Worried about this kingdom. A good man .” The Emperor nodded. “Dead. All of them, dead. My men. *Your* men. Your horse - a beautiful horse, I should add. And brave. I saw the way it leapt across the fiery moat. No other horse would do such a thing .” “Dead defending you ,” said Casper, cold, barely above a whisper. “Dead trying to *kill* you. Dead because of you and the horrors you have unleashed upon this land .” “Certainly ,” said the Emperor. “And I do n't suppose you could be convinced to allow me to continue as I was, eh ?” Casper laughed, nearly weeping with exhaustion and spoiled anxiety. “I never would have guessed you 'd have a sense of humor .” He drew a deep breath and leveled his sword. “But I guess I do n't have much room in my heart for laughter these days .” The Emperor smiled, careful eyes never leaving Casper 's face. “I would n't go so far as to say that the things I 've done have been justified, but it seems it would serve us both to understand what 's at stake .” “Your death ,” said Casper mildly, advancing on the older man. “That is the only thing left on the table. Your reign of terror ends today .” “I 've seen the world - what it becomes ,” said the Emperor hastily, drawing back in his chair. “I 've seen the future. I see it every night when I close my eyes .” “I 'm not concerned with the future ,” said Casper. “Everyone I 've ever loved is dead. My home is half in ruin. What do your nightmares mean to me ?” “The *world* ,” said the Gray Emperor, clutching at the arms of his throne. “You have no idea what it wants to become. No matter what hell you think I 've made here on Earth, you must believe me when I tell how much *worse* it threatens to become .” “Worse than murder ?” said Casper. “Villages burned to the ground? Bloodlines *erased*? Worse than that ?” The Emperor sighed. “I do n't suppose I would ever be able to convince you, but the things I have seen ... they are haunting in ways you could not imagine. What human beings become ... what they do to one another ...” “I have seen the worst of what a human may do .” “Then imagine *demons* !” shouted the Emperor. “Imagine wraiths! Imagine soulless abominations. Feeling nothing. Being nothing. Simply consuming. Ravaging. Anything and everything. Until there is nothing. Because *that* is what I see. *That* is what man strives to make of himself. “I am not a godly man and I do not consider my works holy in any way, but know that the evil I do, I do for the better sake of all mankind. It is a protection. A benediction. I am the evil of the world. I give men like you focus. Hunger. Ambition. I am the lone demon in the dark. And when I am gone, there will be no evil but the evil inside your hearts. The world will be overrun with apathy. No one will be spared .” The Emperor took a slow, steadying breath. Casper watched the old man sweat and shake. “What you describe sounds like freedom ,” said Casper after some time. “It is Hell ,” said the Emperor. “And what if it was just a bad dream ?” The Emperor considered this for some time. “Then I suppose this must be part of the dream, because what torment could be worse than to have done what I 've done ... and been wrong ?” Casper placed the tip of his sword under the Emperor 's neck. “Should I wake you ?”"

Story: I 've waited 15 years for this very day. Today, I start my teaching job at my old elementary school. Whenever I told anyone my reasons for coming back they would always laugh and call me crazy, even my closest friends. But today, I 'll prove them wrong. Today, I will finally see what 's actually on the mythical, “Fourth Floor”. There had always been rumors circulating about it, I even overheard two 3rd graders talking about earlier. Back when I went here, everyone believed there used to be a swimming pool up there, but after a younger student drowned they decided to close it, and now his ghost haunts the school. My older brother claimed that the teachers slept up there, in strange, coffin like beds. All I know is that there 's something there, something that needs to be kept hidden. Now, I would finally be able to solve the mystery for myself. I stood in front of the tall, ominous door that led to the 4th floor. It was a heavy steel door, something that belonged in a high security prison, not an elementary school. The door made a heavy thud as I unlocked it, and slowly, I pushed it open. A gust of cold, heavy air flowed out of the room, followed by the distinct smell of old books. I flicked on the light switch and the florescent lights lit up one by one. I could n't believe my own eyes, on the fourth floor there was n't a swimming pool or coffins, but rows upon rows of file cabinets stacked up to the ceiling. There was only one thing that this could be. On the fourth floor of my elementary school, permanent records were stored. At first I doubted it, there was no way such a place could exist. But after a little searching I had found my name. It had everything in it, there was a write up about the time I had shot chocolate milk out of my nose at my teacher, it had all of my old tests, all of my projects, everything. Everything I had done was carefully recorded and preserved, and locked away for the ages. Do what you want with this information, you can choose to believe it or not to, I honestly do n't know If I believe it myself. I do n't know if there 's something like this at every school, but I do know there is something. The secret basement, the hidden door, the fourth floor. Every school has its legends, its up to you to find the truth."

Story: **Lesson 1: Fire does n't care** Fire does n't have an objective. It does n't have a strategy or a plan. It does n't even hate you, Fire does n't have feelings. Fire burns to make more fire, like a plague makes more and more people sick. A plague does n't care about who or why, it just cares that it is spreading. Fire is a plague. **Lesson 2: Fire can be hurt** Fire is too simple to know it, but it can be hurt all the same. Kick at it 's heart, and snuff out it 's very essence. Use your boots, when you can, keep your face away from the flames. Use your hands, if you have to, it is better than letting fire spread wildly. Use your body, if you must. To protect those whom we are sworn to rescue. To protect our brothers in arms. **Lesson 3: Rely on your brothers. Rely on yourself** -- - Those were the only three lessons that were given to us, before we were sent into a conflagration. There was also a lot of physical training, certainly, to the point that I could accurately throw a flying kick to any surface from shoulder level down. I could even use my gloved hands with such speed and accuracy that the flames never seemed to touch them. Of course, the training grounds were nothing like the field. In the field ... strange things happened. In the field, Fire is more alive. It is not like the captive fire that we create and promptly snuff out in our barracks. It is not even like the careful, tentative fire that we fought on our graduation exam. In the field, Fire is more primal, more raw ... more violent. It pretends to be snuffed, only to bounce back a moment later. In training they told us never to turn our back to Fire. In the field, we learned just how hard it is to follow that maxim. But we fight on. We fight on because there is no hiding from Fire, not if we let it grow. We fight on because we are the only wall to protect our families from this inferno. We fight on, because there is no better choice. Once upon a time, I heard, they used water to douse the flames. Water, such a precious gift, wasted so recklessly. We fight on, with parched throats and dry eyes, because only after a successful day in the field will we be given our water rations to share with our loved ones. Meagre as they are, we fight on because to stop would be to die."

Story: Dear Dirary, Apparently I 'm a god now. But before being a god, I was just an adventurer. I guess that 's what I 'd call it? I 'd go on adventures. Me, some friends, solving problems and slaying monsters. It was pretty fun, not extremely rewarding but job prospects are n't exactly great in my village. Just various shades of merchant - Oh, and one bartender. Anyway, I went on a particular adventure not long ago and things got pretty hectic. Our group was pretty tight though, we handled things well given the circumstances. We had Tess, my childhood friend and our white magic user; Edwin, this total dick from the village who just happens to be amazing with a spear; Slops, a wise, respected old knight who for some reason stuck with the nickname “Slops”; and Ren, a mysterious, extremely powerful Elf mage, reformed villain and all-round great guy. We also had this Lycan with us, Rex. He was cool but at some point he got turned into an *actual* wolf and sort of wandered off in the woods. To cut a long story short: We were tracking a big bad guy hellbent on world annihilation, and for some reason we were the only people trying to stop that from happening. Not sure why. Along the way, we burned down an evil, living castle; hung out with some ghosts; discovered an underwater cult which we also, somehow, burned down; and a bunch of other stuff. Ren actually revealed he was working for the big bad at one point and he killed Slops. Well, the heart attack killed Slops. We were all pretty shocked because Ren is just an awesome guy. He totally came back and saved us near the end though, which was great. Shame about Slops. The world actually got destroyed in some way, like three times. But we fixed it, somehow - I do n't know the specifics. Magic stuff. Ren 's the guy to ask if you want the know-how. At some point during the final, world-saving battle I was legally dead for about 12 minutes. I had a run in with some entity that rules the cosmos, and he declared me a god. I think that sort of spurred me on to kill the evil villain in the end, to be fair. Anyway, that was yesterday. I just sort of slept on it. It does n't feel much different being a god, to be honest with you. Not sure what I 'm supposed to be doing. I 've tried answering prayers, but I was n't hearing any of them. I also ca n't shoot fireballs - I think. I tried smiting the shit out of Edwin, but I 'm not sure if it worked. He 's such a dick. I 'm gon na meet Ren in a bit ... Just to, y'know, hang out. Maybe he knows a bit about this god stuff because he knows a lot of things. Such a cool guy. I might see what Tess is up to, but she 's probably with Edwin and he 'll cramp mine and Ren 's style. What a dick. So, Diary, that was my week. Sorry I did n't write for a while - I was saving the world! Hehe. I 'll update when I 've figured out this godhood business. I honestly have no idea what I 'm doing. Bye!"

Just the other day there was an old woman who wanted me to find her a vulture bird because she needed a hunting companion ... luckily my lovely wife told her that that was illegal both on the muggle and the wizardry worlds. But what weird me the most are all those cages my wife and our employee handle all day, those that seem to have nothing inside, they give me the chills. Luckily I’ve made some friends with the locals, specially this incredible huge guy who hangs at the bar frequently, he is always interested on hearing me talk about normal everyday animals, and then he talks and talks about things i can hardly believe, dragons and mermaids, nargles and hypogriphs. I love my wife and the world she lives in, and i love that i can see at least part of it, but some nights i ca n't sleep thinking about those empty cages, and what if my wife and myself are not seeing even weirder things out there. =========== I 'm not good at English: ("

Story: My lovely wife, she is a witch. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, she just born that way. The first witch from a muggle family. I still remember the day she brought me to this Diagon Alley, I could not believe nor understand two thirds of what was going on, she laugh and laugh at my dropped jaw and pushed me inside this toy store on a corner. There a red hair man was telling a joke and kids around him where clapping. “That 's George Weasley ,” she said, “I told you about him already .” and she had, that secret war that run about 20 years ago, she was a little kid back then not even having received her acceptance letter. But now she was a witch, a proper witch, and I am her husband, which is nice, do n't get me wrong, but its so weird. Specially at the store. I bought the store 3 years ago, as I 'm a veterinarian I though I could do it, I mean, I just have to sell kids pets, how complicated could that be? oh ... boy ... you have no idea.

Story: I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I 've done in life can not be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it 's the business I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I 'm 52 now -- probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there 's one thing I do n't regret and it 's taking the life of a criminal who did n't belong. I hunt evil people who 've caused misery to communities and I believe I 've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a .357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I did n't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell."

Story: Once upon a time, in a little village called Portempo, there lived a little boy named Jim-Jam. Jim-Jam lived an ordinary life in the village. Like most people, he walked the cobblestone streets, no longer under threat of dragon attack. Jim-Jam stopped and took a seat next to the the Jar-Jam memorial statue which sits in the main square. “One goal, one gift, one future. - General Jar-Jam ( dragon defense division )” The dedication plaque gleamed brightly in the midday sun. A reminder of the sacrifice made by the elders just 10 years ago. From his pocket satchel, Jim-Jam pulled out a dragon roast sandwich and took an ambitious bite. He chewed voraciously as he watched the lives of his bustling village play out. There was Jay-Jam, the village spiritual leader. Originally from a town about 10 days on foot, Jay-Jam fled with as many survivors as he could gather when the mountain clans forced their way through the uninhabitable zone and claimed his village for their own. Jay-Jam waved at passersby as his children, adoptive orphans of war, passed out leaflets announcing the upcoming worship festival. Having finished his sandwich, Jim-Jam took a sip of pumpkin ale. An orphan of war himself, Jim-Jam has taken to hanging around the blacksmith 's shook. Jak-Jam made the finest weapons and mining carts this side of the Tempo river and is expecting Jim-Jam to deliver a very important package, a very common job for orphans of war to take on. As he approached Jak-Jam shop a little boy, younger than Jim-Jam stopped him to say hello. It was Joi-Jam, a classmate of his who enjoys reading huge books and conducting science experiments for fun. With courteousness being a core value of Portempo, Jim-Jam patiently conversed as Joi-Jam rambled on about the progress Professor Jet-Jam was making with his attempt to create a cure for the Jug-Jam Virus, named after Doctor Jug-Jam who first discovered the potential lethality of the previously unknown pathogen which claimed hundreds of Miners'lives. Politely excusing himself, Jim-Jam eventually made his way into the blacksmith 's shop and greeted Jak-Jam as he handed the parcel over. Jak-Jam smiled and thanked the boy, handing him a small sack of coins for his efforts. Jim-Jam jingled as he made his way home.

Story: Once upon a time, in a little village called Portempo, there lived a little boy named Jim-Jam. Jim-Jam lived an ordinary life in the village. Like most people, he walked the cobblestone streets, no longer under threat of dragon attack. Jim-Jam stopped and took a seat next to the the Jar-Jam memorial statue which sits in the main square. “One goal, one gift, one future. - General Jar-Jam ( dragon defense division )” The dedication plaque gleamed brightly in the midday sun. A reminder of the sacrifice made by the elders just 10 years ago. From his pocket satchel, Jim-Jam pulled out a dragon roast sandwich and took an ambitious bite. He chewed voraciously as he watched the lives of his bustling village play out. There was Jay-Jam, the village spiritual leader. Originally from a town about 10 days on foot, Jay-Jam fled with as many survivors as he could gather when the mountain clans forced their way through the uninhabitable zone and claimed his village for their own. Jay-Jam waved at passersby as his children, adoptive orphans of war, passed out leaflets announcing the upcoming worship festival. Having finished his sandwich, Jim-Jam took a sip of pumpkin ale. An orphan of war himself, Jim-Jam has taken to hanging around the blacksmith 's shook. Jak-Jam made the finest weapons and mining carts this side of the Tempo river and is expecting Jim-Jam to deliver a very important package, a very common job for orphans of war to take on. As he approached Jak-Jam shop a little boy, younger than Jim-Jam stopped him to say hello. It was Joi-Jam, a classmate of his who enjoys reading huge books and conducting science experiments for fun. With courteousness being a core value of Portempo, Jim-Jam patiently conversed as Joi-Jam rambled on about the progress Professor Jet-Jam was making with his attempt to create a cure for the Jug-Jam Virus, named after Doctor Jug-Jam who first discovered the potential lethality of the previously unknown pathogen which claimed hundreds of Miners'lives. Politely excusing himself, Jim-Jam eventually made his way into the blacksmith 's shop and greeted Jak-Jam as he handed the parcel over. Jak-Jam smiled and thanked the boy, handing him a small sack of coins for his efforts. Jim-Jam jingled as he made his way home.

I had never wronged them, but their laughter howled and bounced and echoed hollow. It pierced my ears as they passed me, unnoticed. Just as they had passed me so often. Constantly making a fool of me. They saw me as an ape, a whipping horse. My heart thrown on a pedestal for display as it was crushed again and again beneath their cruel boots. Not once more would I play the fool. Not once more would I listen I the chorus of their gaiety. No. Our boots clacked over the stones of the bridge. My blade was silent running out of its leather home and across their throats. Their bodies dropped in loud thuds against the edge of bridge. Blood poured out onto the stones below.

Story: If everything went perfectly right, her creation could drive back hell. If it went wrong, all hope for a habitable Earth would be lost. She gazed upon it once more, admiration and fear drawing a conflicted smile upon her paper face. It dominated everything, the greenhouse suddenly became the center of the Earth. Vines and mosses nestled against the globe, blending with iron valves and copper pipes. The components seemed to grow naturally, as if she had not constructed it herself, but the Earth had somehow willed it into creation. Slowly, for what could be the last time, she run her hand along the length of a fern, leading her fingers to a rusted valve. The rubber coils breathed with fluid. Sparks jumped along cables towards the thing. In awe, the woman stepped back, nearly tripping on an empty plant pot. “Holy shit ...” was all she could manage to think. This was possibly the last sanctuary of abundant life on Earth, and she was risking it all. A high metallic whine stirred in the orb, and a shudder rattled the entire room, sending birds and insects into noisy retreat. Steam hissed from all over and the whine grew exponentially in volume. Soon, she could see nothing, hear nothing. She had fallen to the ground, cowering from the beast that was awakening. There was no way of knowing whether it was a success till after. If it was a failure, she 'd probably be dead, and for all she knew, she could be dead. For an eternity her senses were void and her fear was on overdrive. At some point in the eternity, it ended. A pulse of energy shot from a short antenna above the heart, clearing the fog and bringing complete silence. Eden got to her feet, she slapped her arm, burnt like she was alive. Birdsong filled the room. It was time to see her results. Shaken, she stumbled to the window of the glasshouse. She looked out at what had been miles of barren wasteland. A tear rolled down her cheek. Fighting, struggling, life dragged itself from the scarred ground. The desert around her house on the hill blossomed with colors. The colors of life."

Each generation or so, warriors come to the hall to inherit a weapon that they are worthy enough to wield. Across the hall you see a forgotten weapon that 's been collecting dust. You hear it call to you.

Story: Waking with a start, my blankets strewn wildly about my floor, thrown from my bed as I slept. It was just a dream ... It had to be; there 's no other explanation for it. But, I 've never had such a vivid dream before; not just seeing, but tasting the cold mustiness of the air, feeling the chill of the marble on the soles of my feet, hearing the quiet rustling of unseen trees, the muted clangor of steel on steel, battle cries and shouts in every language. Shaking my head and sitting up, my pillows twisted and disordered behind me, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I look over at the wall and gawp, looking for a long moment as my cheeks flush red with a riot of conflicting feelings. -- It 's cold; my first instinct is to cover myself. Wearing only my plaid flannel pants, my toes flex against the floor, its hard surface almost slick to the touch. The guttering candles cast flickering shadows across the blue and yellow stones of the floor, send shades flitting up the length of the fluted columns lining the hall, and cloak the sides of the hall in dancing shrouds. I can almost see into the closest niche, to my left, a branch ... no, it 's been carved, so perhaps a club. Feeling drawn forward, I shiver slightly and let my feet move me further into the hall; the marble frigid beneath my feet now, drawing the heat from me, the dull roar of far off combat fading as I tread deeper into the hall. To each side, there are weapons, that much is clear, though the shadows and my need to keep walking make it difficult to catch more than a passing glimpse. As I walk though, some look vaguely familiar, a bulky hammer encrusted in runes, a finely crafted and gilded sword, displayed alongside its sheath, a Hasta, the point seeming wet with blood, even a series of bronze rapiers, gleaming brightly in the flickering light, the boar tusk helms behind them catching my eye. Moving still deeper into the shadows of the hall, a new sound reaches my ears, that of chanting, melodic and slow, singing praises, seeking benedictions, and giving devotions to God. The ecclesiastical Latin seeming somehow familiar to my ears, an instinctive understanding welling up from the very depths of my soul. To my sides now are effigies on the walls, holding their swords gently by the top of the pommel, gazing down at the path upon which I walk, seeming to both judge and welcome at once. One in particular, seems to call me off the path, my feet moving of their own volition, leading me to a towering man, his face obscured by the weathering of ages, but still conveying fierce loyalty, his cloak drawn about him as if to ward off the mountain chill. In his grip, almost singing to me now, is a sword, not as ornate as some of the others, but with a hilt inlaid with gold, small plates set over hollows along its length. The edge, though dusty and in shadow, gleams slightly, its edge seeming as sharp as the day it was made. In my gut, something tells me to take the blade and its simple sheath; so I do. The world explodes into a brilliant shimmering cascade for what feels like eternity. -- Leaning against my bedroom wall, supported by a simple, rustic kite shield, is the sword; my sword; Durendal. I can feel, almost hear, conflicted whispering in the back of my mind; one voice, very distant and faint, calling for a wife, a son, a distant homeland. The other voice, much stronger, but still a whisper, repeats a mantra in a tongue I ca n't quite understand, somewhere between French, and Latin, the tone unmistakably martial, a call to battle, a call to righteous war, a call to fight for my people, to forge anew the strength and vigor of my kin. At last, I understand. The men of the West must rise from their slumber."

Feeling drawn forward, I shiver slightly and let my feet move me further into the hall; the marble frigid beneath my feet now, drawing the heat from me, the dull roar of far off combat fading as I tread deeper into the hall. To each side, there are weapons, that much is clear, though the shadows and my need to keep walking make it difficult to catch more than a passing glimpse. As I walk though, some look vaguely familiar, a bulky hammer encrusted in runes, a finely crafted and gilded sword, displayed alongside its sheath, a Hasta, the point seeming wet with blood, even a series of bronze rapiers, gleaming brightly in the flickering light, the boar tusk helms behind them catching my eye. Moving still deeper into the shadows of the hall, a new sound reaches my ears, that of chanting, melodic and slow, singing praises, seeking benedictions, and giving devotions to God. The ecclesiastical Latin seeming somehow familiar to my ears, an instinctive understanding welling up from the very depths of my soul. To my sides now are effigies on the walls, holding their swords gently by the top of the pommel, gazing down at the path upon which I walk, seeming to both judge and welcome at once. One in particular, seems to call me off the path, my feet moving of their own volition, leading me to a towering man, his face obscured by the weathering of ages, but still conveying fierce loyalty, his cloak drawn about him as if to ward off the mountain chill. In his grip, almost singing to me now, is a sword, not as ornate as some of the others, but with a hilt inlaid with gold, small plates set over hollows along its length. The edge, though dusty and in shadow, gleams slightly, its edge seeming as sharp as the day it was made. In my gut, something tells me to take the blade and its simple sheath; so I do. The world explodes into a brilliant shimmering cascade for what feels like eternity. -- Leaning against my bedroom wall, supported by a simple, rustic kite shield, is the sword; my sword; Durendal. I can feel, almost hear, conflicted whispering in the back of my mind; one voice, very distant and faint, calling for a wife, a son, a distant homeland. The other voice, much stronger, but still a whisper, repeats a mantra in a tongue I ca n't quite understand, somewhere between French, and Latin, the tone unmistakably martial, a call to battle, a call to righteous war, a call to fight for my people, to forge anew the strength and vigor of my kin. At last, I understand. The men of the West must rise from their slumber."

Each generation or so, warriors come to the hall to inherit a weapon that they are worthy enough to wield. Across the hall you see a forgotten weapon that 's been collecting dust. You hear it call to you.

Story: Waking with a start, my blankets strewn wildly about my floor, thrown from my bed as I slept. It was just a dream ... It had to be; there 's no other explanation for it. But, I 've never had such a vivid dream before; not just seeing, but tasting the cold mustiness of the air, feeling the chill of the marble on the soles of my feet, hearing the quiet rustling of unseen trees, the muted clangor of steel on steel, battle cries and shouts in every language. Shaking my head and sitting up, my pillows twisted and disordered behind me, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I look over at the wall and gawp, looking for a long moment as my cheeks flush red with a riot of conflicting feelings. -- It 's cold; my first instinct is to cover myself. Wearing only my plaid flannel pants, my toes flex against the floor, its hard surface almost slick to the touch. The guttering candles cast flickering shadows across the blue and yellow stones of the floor, send shades flitting up the length of the fluted columns lining the hall, and cloak the sides of the hall in dancing shrouds.
